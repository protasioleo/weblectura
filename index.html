<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a><b class="calibre4">Prologue</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	tilted	my	head	back	to	look	at	the	cloud-filled	sky.	Large,	grey	puffs	danced	and</i> <i class="calibre3">swirled	overhead. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A	drop	of	water	landed	on	my	nose.	I	brought	my	head	forward	and	wiped	up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">the	bead	with	my	finger	before	it	had	a	chance	to	spill	down	my	face. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 stared	 at	 the	 liquid;	 a	 smile	 pulled	 at	 the	 corners	 of	 my	 lips,	 stretching</i> <i class="calibre3">them	until	my	eyes	crinkled.	Another	droplet	landed	on	the	top	of	my	head,	cool</i> <i class="calibre3">and	wet.	It	trickled	down	the	part	in	my	hair,	leaving	behind	a	trail	of	tingling</i> <i class="calibre3">skin.	I	reached	up	with	my	other	hand	and	scratched	it	away. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Laughing	voices	caught	my	attention	and	for	a	moment	pulled	me	away	from</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">the	dripping	sky. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sound	 of	 a	 whisper	 filled	 my	 ears	 and	 interrupted	 my	 dream.	 My	 eyelids fluttered	 open.	 The	 streetlight	 outside	 lit	 my	 room	 and	 shadows	 danced	 across my	ceiling.	My	heart	skipped	as	they	moved	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 my	 head	 and	 opened	 my	 mouth.	 Before	 any	 sound	 could	 escape	 a hand	 clamped	 it	 shut	 and	 my	 eyes	 filled	 with	 darkness.	 I	 struggled	 against	 the weight	on	my	arms	as	my	legs	tried	to	kick	free	from	under	the	blankets.	A	harsh</p>
<p class="calibre1">ripping	sound	halted	my	efforts.	For	a	second	my	mouth	was	freed;	I	called	out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 my	 cries	 were	 muffled	 by	 a	 large	 piece	 of	 tape.	 My	 arm	 jerked	 as	 a	 sharp point	pierced	the	skin	of	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	muscles	eased	and	relaxed	and	my	movements	slowed.	The	pressure	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	arms	abated.	I	willed	them	to	move	and	strike	out	at	the	nearest	object,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	lay	still	at	my	sides.	The	skin	on	my	cheeks	and	lips	stretched	upward	as	the tape	used	to	seal	my	mouth	came	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	yelled,	but	the	sound	I	heard	came	from	inside	my	own	head,	my	voice	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	silenced.	The	blindfold	was	tugged	away;	the	dim	light	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black	 shadows	 loomed	 in	 front	 of	 me,	 devoid	 of	 form	 or	 shape	 –	 blurred, dark	blobs	moved	in	the	night.	My	eyelids	slammed	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Move	them	out!”	A	voice	bellowed.	And	then	there	was	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a><b class="calibre4">One	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Sterile</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 woke	 to	 the	 bright	 and	 unpleasant	 buzz	 of	 the	 overhead	 lights.	 The	 sterile, white	room	glowed	with	such	intensity	it	was	almost	blinding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 happened	 every	 morning,	 first	 the	 click,	 then	 the	 hum.	 My	 eyelids	 flew open	as	though	a	power	button	inside	my	head	was	flicked	to	the	'on'	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	arm	rose	to	cover	my	face	and	shield	me	from	the	bright	lights.	It	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	way	for	as	long	as	I	remembered	which	seemed	both	a	long	time	and	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rolled	 over	 onto	 my	 right	 side,	 and	 my	 eyes	 darted	 between	 three	 sliding doors	on	the	wall	parallel	to	my	bed.	The	first,	located	directly	across	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">resting	head,	was	the	entry.	The	door	I	passed	through	twice	a	day,	once	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	the	room	and	then	again	when	I	came	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	gaze	skimmed	a	little	further	to	the	left.	In	the	middle	of	the	wall	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 smaller	 opening	 of	 the	 dumbwaiter.	 I	 favoured	 that	 door	 as	 each	 whoosh signaled	a	meal	or	snack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tucked	my	chin	a	little	and	looked	over	toward	the	third	opening	at	the	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	of	the	wall.	My	focus	drifted	toward	the	white	surveillance	camera	with	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever-watchful	red	eye.	For	the	moment,	it	pointed	directly	at	my	bed,	silent	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">still.	Yet,	once	I	rose	it	would	awaken	and	begin	its	daily	routine	of	stalking	me around	 my	 room.	 I	 resisted	 the	 urge	 to	 wave	 and	 returned	 my	 attention	 to	 the laundry	 chute.	 It	 wasn't	 as	 big	 as	 the	 entry	 but	 certainly	 larger	 than	 the dumbwaiter.	 Large	 enough,	 in	 fact,	 I	 believed	 it	 could	 hold	 two	 small	 or	 even average	sized	people.  <i class="calibre3">Who	would	try? </i>	The	thought	made	my	skin	prickle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 three	 doors	 remained	 closed	 and	 silent,	 but	 soon	 the	 daily	 procedures would	begin.	The	sound	of	sliding	doors	would	replace	the	irritating	hum	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead	lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	flung	back	my	pale	sheet,	my	eyes	skimmed	over	my	green	nightgown,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 up.	 The	 whirring	 of	 the	 camera	 drowned	 out	 the	 buzzing	 lights,	 and	 it caught	 my	 attention.	 It	 was	 only	 in	 those	 first	 few	 minutes	 of	 the	 day	 that	 the sounds	 of	 the	 room	 were	 grating.	 Soon	 the	 noises	 would	 disappear	 into	 the background.	Only	recalled	at	night	when	they	finally	quieted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 thought	 suddenly	 came	 to	 mind	 and	 erased	 my	 irritation.	 I	 was	 getting	 a surprise	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	swung	my	legs	over	the	side	of	the	bed	and	rested	my	feet	on	the	white	tile</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor.	 Soothing	 warmth	 radiated	 through	 my	 body	 and	 tempted	 me	 to	 lie	 down on	the	hard	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 whoosh	 of	 the	 day	 interrupted	 my	 thoughts.	 The	 door	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>dumbwaiter	had	opened;	my	breakfast	had	arrived.	Small	gurgles	deep	inside	my stomach	 rolled	 through	 my	 gut.	 It	 finally	 concluded	 with	 a	 loud,	 inhuman grumble	as	the	smell	of	bacon	wafted	through	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rushed	toward	the	small	compartment	behind	my	table	and	pulled	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered	tray.	I	breathed	in	the	delicious	smell.	My	free	hand	curled	into	a	tight fist	at	my	side	as	a	distant	and	unclear	memory	flashed	in	front	of	me.	I	placed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tray	on	the	table,	exhaled,	and	uncurled	my	hand.	Morning	procedures	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hurried	toward	the	fourth	door	in	my	room	which	led	to	the	washroom.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	unlike	the	others	and	made	no	sound	when	pulled	open.	It	sat	centred	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	wall	closest	to	the	head	of	my	bed.	The	only	thing	that	gave	the	door	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	the	small,	clear	glass	knob	that	stuck	out	from	the	bleached	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	light	turned	on	the	instant	I	pushed	open	the	door.	The	small	bathroom</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	as	clean	and	white	as	the	rest	of	my	room.	I	stepped	further	in	and	jumped</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	the	door	clicked	closed	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	down	on	the	toilet	seat	and	emptied	my	bladder.	The	sound	echoed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	small	room,	and	I	couldn't	help	but	wonder	if	anyone	heard.  <i class="calibre3">Hurry	up! </i>	I	told myself.	I	leaned	forward	and	rested	my	elbows	on	my	thighs	and	held	my	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 toilet	 flushed	 on	 its	 own.	 The	 water	 drained	 with	 such	 force	 that	 tiny drops	sprayed	up	onto	the	seat.	I	didn't	bother	to	wipe	it	away;	the	room	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soap	 dispenser	 whined	 and	 spat	 out	 a	 foamy	 liquid	 that	 was	 as	 free	 of colour	 and	 scent	 as	 everything	 else.	 I	 moved	 my	 hands	 under	 the	 tap	 and activated	 the	 warm	 water.	 Tiny	 bubbles	 squeezed	 out	 between	 my	 fingers	 and covered	the	backs	of	my	hands.	The	white	froth	swirled	around	before	it	gurgled</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 the	 drain.	 The	 distant	 whisper	 of	 some	 strange	 tune	 peeked	 out	 from	 the shadows	in	my	mind.	My	eyes	squeezed	shut,	and	I	worked	at	remembering	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lyrics.	As	a	word	was	about	to	form,	the	water	turned	off	signaling	the	end	of	my hand	washing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyelids	fluttered	open,	and	my	heart	skipped	as	I	caught	my	reflection	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mirror.	I	stared	at	myself	for	a	second.	My	straight,	light	brown	hair	rested	on the	 top	 of	 my	 shoulders,	 freshly	 cut	 from	 the	 day	 before.	 The	 light	 blinked	 in warning,	a	reminder	my	time	in	the	bathroom	was	over.	I	would	have	to	examine</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	closer	the	next	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pushed	the	button	on	the	wall	and	pulled	the	door	open.	The	alarm	buzzed; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	five-second	countdown	had	begun.	I	stepped	over	the	threshold,	and	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	 behind	 me.	 An	 audible	 hissing	 sound	 came	 to	 my	 ears	 as	 scalding	 hot steam	 filled	 the	 small	 room.	 The	 hissing	 stirred	 a	 distant	 voice;	 it	 whispered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>from	 somewhere	 deep	 inside	 my	 head.	 Garbled	 and	 incomprehensible	 words bounced	and	echoed	in	my	skull.  <i class="calibre3">Sick</i>	was	all	I	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intrusive	 beeping	 pulled	 me	 away	 from	 the	 door	 and	 my	 thoughts	 as	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">headed	 back	 over	 to	 my	 table.	 I	 only	 had	 three	 minutes	 left	 to	 finish	 my breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	smell	of	bacon	saturated	the	air	around	me	the	second	I	removed	the	lid</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 my	 tray.	 Three	 pieces	 of	 crispy	 bacon,	 scrambled	 eggs,	 and	 home	 fries covered	 the	 plastic	 plate.	 My	 tongue	 swept	 across	 my	 lips,	 and	 I	 stared	 at	 the colourful	arrangement	of	food	in	front	of	me.	Unfortunately,	I	didn't	have	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	to	revel	in	its	taste,	but	that	didn't	concern	me.	The	meal	would	repeat	itself in	so	many	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 breakfast	 over,	 I	 sealed	 the	 dishes	 back	 inside	 the	 dumbwaiter.	 The whining	camera	pricked	my	ears	as	it	followed	me	across	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	plain	white	dresser	sat	in	the	corner,	wedged	between	the	end	wall	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 head	 of	 my	 bed.	 I	 pulled	 open	 the	 top	 drawer	 and	 removed	 a	 white	 paper robe	wrapped	in	plastic	and	placed	it	on	top.	I	stripped	the	sheets	from	my	bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">scooped	them	up	in	my	arms,	and	retrieved	the	neatly	packaged	robe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	up	at	the	surveillance	system	as	I	crossed	the	room	on	a	diagonal</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 it	 and	 the	 laundry	 chute.	 The	 only	 good	 thing	 was	 I	 would	 soon disappear	from	its	view.	The	camera	was	unable	to	see	me	in	the	corner	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	underneath	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pressed	 a	 button,	 and	 the	 door	 to	 the	 laundry	 chute	 slid	 open.	 I	 piled	 the sheets	 inside,	 the	 plastic	 package	 dangled	 from	 my	 teeth,	 and	 I	 pulled	 my nightgown	 over	 my	 head.	 My	 hair	 stood	 on	 end;	 static	 electricity	 crackled.	 I removed	my	underwear	and	tossed	all	my	nightclothes	onto	the	pile.	I	tore	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 plastic	 package	 and	 pulled	 on	 the	 paper	 robe.	 Before	 I	 closed	 the	 door,	 I threw	the	packaging	in	with	the	laundry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 feet	 took	 me	 the	 few	 steps	 along	 the	 wall	 and	 over	 toward	 my	 table where	 I	 sat	 down	 and	 waited.	 I	 stared	 at	 the	 dimmed	 red	 light	 above	 the entrance.	 Within	 seconds	 of	 sitting	 down,	 the	 light	 glowed,	 and	 the	 door	 slid open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	through	the	entrance	covered	from	top	to	bottom	in	white	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed	his	cart	into	the	room	in	front	of	him.	The	only	part	of	him	that	showed</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 his	 brown	 eyes	 peeking	 out	 from	 the	 holes	 in	 the	 hooded	 mask.	 Over	 the mask	he	wore	goggles.	I	called	him	 <i class="calibre3">he, </i>	but	I	wasn't	sure.	The	baggy	suit	gave	no sign	of	curves	or	bumps	of	any	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	paper	robe	crinkled	as	I	brought	my	right	arm	forward	and	rested	it	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	table.	I	bent	my	left	arm	and	placed	it	in	front	of	me.	He	pushed	his	little	cart against	the	table	and	stood	on	the	other	side.	My	attention	focused	on	his	white-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>gloved	hands	as	he	prepared	two	injections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	syringe,	already	prepared,	sat	on	the	cart.	I	recalled	seeing	it	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	was	unsure	of	its	use.	I	narrowed	my	gaze	as	I	stared	at	the	mystery	needle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 memory	 flashed	 of	 a	 gloved	 hand	 picking	 up	 the	 syringe,	 followed	 by	 a stinging	 prick,	 and	 then	 darkness.	 I	 shuddered	 and	 small	 bumps	 rose	 on	 my arms.	I	had	received	that	injection.	It	was	the	consequence	should	you	find	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength	to	resist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 his	 rubber	 gloved	 hands	 held	 my	 arm	 as	 the	 other	 wiped	 a	 small gauze	pad	against	my	shoulder.	The	cold	dampness	caused	more	bumps	to	rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	nose	wrinkled	at	the	strong	smell.	His	rubbery	fingers	compressed	the	skin</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 my	 shoulder.	 The	 silver	 point	 of	 the	 needle	 pierced	 my	 flesh.	 He	 pushed down	on	the	plunger.	I	concentrated	on	feeling	the	clear	liquid	as	it	entered	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">body,	but	it	was	not	possible.	When	he	finished,	he	pulled	it	free	and	placed	the gauze	 pad	 back	 on	 my	 arm.	 He	 repeated	 the	 process	 with	 the	 second	 needle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again,	I	focused	on	the	liquid	and	much	like	the	first	time,	I	felt	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 pulled	 the	 needle	 out,	 he	 dabbed	 at	 the	 small	 point	 of	 red	 blood	 that had	bubbled	to	the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	idea	what	my	surprise	is?”	I	whispered.	My	voice	sounded	foreign	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	ears.  <i class="calibre3">Why? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stopped	 dabbing	 for	 a	 split	 second	 as	 though	 my	 speaking	 had	 caught him	off	guard,	and	then	he	resumed	his	work.	He	placed	a	small	bandage	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder,	 cleaned	 up	 his	 tray,	 and	 hurried	 from	 the	 room.	 The	 sliding	 doors closed	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn't	think	so,”	I	whispered	to	the	sterile	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	overhead	light	flashed	its	warning.	I	groaned.	“I	know,”	I	said	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">clenched	teeth	as	I	stood	up	and	shoved	my	chair	back.	Its	felt-covered	feet	slid over	the	floor.	I	moved	toward	the	washroom;	my	paper	robe	rustled	with	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">step.	The	back	of	my	head	burned	with	the	sensation	of	watching	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wadded	the	paper	robe	into	a	ball	and	placed	it	inside	the	plastic	tube	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">hung	between	the	sink	and	the	toilet.	Within	seconds	it	disappeared,	sucked	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	sight	with	a	loud	pop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	small	shower	stall	stood	in	the	corner	opposite	the	toilet.	The	glass	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">slid	 open	 as	 I	 stepped	 toward	 it.	 Once	 inside,	 warm	 water	 gushed	 out,	 and	 I closed	 my	 eyes,	 revelling	 in	 the	 relaxing	 spray.	 I	 only	 had	 a	 minute	 or	 two	 to enjoy	it	as	the	soothing	warmth	would	end	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 washed	 my	 hair	 with	 creamy,	 unscented	 liquid,	 squeezed	 out	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispenser	 on	 the	 wall.	 Below	 that	 was	 the	 dispenser	 for	 the	 body	 wash.	 Yet, another	colourless	and	odourless	gel	that	oozed	into	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bathroom	 light	 flashed,	 warning	 me	 my	 shower	 would	 be	 over	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>seconds.	I	stepped	toward	the	door	and	when	it	opened	the	water	turned	off.	The mat's	rubber	bristles	tickled	my	feet	as	I	stepped	down	on	them.	Warm	air	shot</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	from	the	wall	behind	me,	from	the	ceiling,	and	from	the	mat	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	a	slow	circle;	rivulets	of	water	ran	down	my	body	and	evaporated.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">combed	my	fingers	through	my	hair	and	worked	out	some	of	the	tangles	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed	 while	 washing.	 I	 bent	 over;	 the	 warm	 air	 blew	 my	 hair	 around	 in	 wild fashion.	I	resisted	the	urge	to	close	my	eyes	and	stared	at	my	feet	instead.	Soon the	light	would	flicker	and	my	time	in	the	blowers	would	be	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 open	 the	 medicine	 cabinet.	 Inside	 were	 many	 plastic	 wrapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">toothbrushes	 and	 one-use	 packets	 of	 toothpaste.	 I	 selected	 one	 of	 each	 and closed	the	door.	The	toothbrush	was	like	everything	else	in	the	room	–	white	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporary.	I	ripped	it	from	its	cocoon	of	clear	plastic	and	covered	it	with	every bit	 of	 paste	 from	 the	 packet.	 The	 bristles	 massaged	 over	 my	 gums	 and	 teeth, removing	all	traces	of	food	and	bacteria.	When	finished,	I	held	everything	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tube	and	watched	as	it	was	sucked	out	of	existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 into	 the	 mirror	 and	 combed	 out	 my	 hair	 with	 my	 fingers.	 I	 leaned close,	almost	touching	it	with	my	nose,	and	looked	into	my	blue	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	you?”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><b class="calibre4">Two	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Surprise</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	the	middle	drawer	of	my	dresser	were	several	packages	containing	a	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">bra	 and	 a	 pair	 of	 plain	 underwear.	 I	 chose	 a	 set	 and	 pulled	 it	 out.	 The	 plastic wrap	crinkled.	The	camera	droned	behind	me,	its	mechanical	noise	louder	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual.  <i class="calibre3">Why	had	I	gotten	rid	of	my	robe? </i>	The	thought	caused	my	stomach	to	knot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 question	 was	 rhetorical;	 I	 knew	 the	 answer.	 It's	 what	 I'd	 always	 done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	for	some	strange	reason,	being	naked	suddenly	bothered	me.	If	it	weren't	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	warning,	I	would	have	still	been	in	the	washroom	trying	to	think	of	a	way	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	 myself.	 I	 pulled	 on	 my	 underclothes	 and	 breathed	 easier	 as	 my	 body relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	yanked	the	bottom	drawer	open	with	too	much	force.	It	slid	out	with	ease, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	my	quick	reflexes	stopped	it	before	it	freed	itself	from	the	rails	and	landed on	 my	 feet.	 I	 pulled	 the	 remaining	 green	 dress	 from	 inside	 and	 pushed	 the drawer	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	dresses	were	the	only	things	I	had	that	weren't	encased	in	plastic.	I	ran</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 hands	 over	 the	 soft	 fabric	 and	 carefully	 unfolded	 the	 dress.	 It	 was	 plain, short-sleeved,	and	came	to	below	my	knees.	Three	buttons	closed	it	at	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	elastic	cinched	it	in	at	the	waist.	Two	large	pockets	adorned	the	skirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	red	eye	followed	my	every	step	toward	the	laundry	chute,	but	I	kept	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaze	 focused	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 When	 I	 reached	 the	 opening,	 I	 pressed	 the	 button nearby	and	the	door	slid	open	with	a	faint,	airy	sound.	My	eyes	widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	white	envelope	sat	on	top	of	the	packaged	clean	linens.	I	leaned	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment	 to	 get	 a	 better	 look.	 I	 reached	 out	 my	 hand	 but	 hesitated	 for	 a second;	 my	 heart	 had	 picked	 up	 speed.	 I	 concentrated	 on	 the	 lettering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A20100315L	was	penned	with	care	in	black	ink	on	the	front.  <i class="calibre3">That's	me! </i>	I	smiled at	the	sudden	realization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 reached	 out,	 grabbed	 the	 envelope,	 and	 stuffed	 it	 down	 the	 front	 of	 my dress.	I	closed	my	eyes	for	a	second	and	slowed	my	breath.	The	action	calmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	nervous	excitement,	and	I	grabbed	the	packaged	linens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 thoughts	 raced	 as	 I	 moved	 back	 toward	 my	 bed	 and	 started	 unpacking the	sterile	sheets.	The	envelope	rumpled	and	poked	into	my	chest	while	I	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	bed.	Each	movement	reminded	me	of	its	existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	every	effort	not	to	reach	inside	my	dress	and	pull	it	out.	The	poking</p>
<p class="calibre1">annoyed	me,	and	it	was	getting	difficult	to	contain	my	building	curiosity.	Still,	it would	have	to	wait	until	I	began	my	studies.	My	body	would	block	the	intruding</p>
<p class="calibre1">surveillance	system	behind	me,	and	I	could	read	the	note	in	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	desk	sat	at	the	foot	of	my	bed.	It	was	a	plain	white	table	with	one	small</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>drawer	for	writing	tools	and	a	bit	of	paper.	Textbooks	and	other	reading	material sat	on	a	shelf	mounted	above	it.	It	was	in	this	corner	of	the	room,	across	from	the intruding	camera,	that	I	studied	whatever	textbook	happened	to	be	on	the	shelf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	padded	white	desk	chair	rolled	with	ease	as	I	took	my	seat.	I	pulled	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	black	textbook	with	its	silver	lettering	from	the	overhead	shelf.	The	camera</p>
<p class="calibre1">whined	 behind	 me	 as	 I	 moved.	 The	 back	 of	 my	 hand	 slid	 across	 my	 forehead, smearing	 away	 tiny	 beads	 of	 sweat.

While	 a	 part	 of	 me feared	 I'd	 contracted	 some	 illness	 another	 part	 assured	 me	 my	 feelings	 were normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 opened	 the	 textbook	 to	 where	 I'd	 left	 off.	 I	 removed	 the	 envelope	 from inside	my	dress,	held	the	damp	packet	in	my	hands,	and	stared	at	my	ID.	I	had</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 at	 the	 letter,	 lost	 in	 the	 writings	 penned	 by	 its	 creator.	 A	 sudden whooshing	from	behind	entered	my	ears	and	startled	me.	I	was	no	longer	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stuffed	 the	 letter	 into	 the	 pages	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 book	 and	 pretended	 to study. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	A2!	Busy	with	your	studies?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>His	 voice	 was	 familiar,	 but	 I	 couldn't	 quite	 place	 it.	 I	 eased	 around	 in	 my chair.	He	stood	behind	me	a	few	feet	away,	his	hands	on	his	hips.	My	lips	parted</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 little,	 and	 I	 nodded.  <i class="calibre3">Was	 it	 okay	 if	 I	 nodded? </i>	 My	 heart	 thumped.  <i class="calibre3">What	 if	 I</i> <i class="calibre3">wasn't	supposed	to	acknowledge	anyone? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 thin	 red	 smile	 came	 across	 his	 face,	 and	 my	 heart	 slowed.	 My	 head</p>
<p class="calibre1">nodding	hadn't	surprised	him.	He	stepped	closer;	his	clothing	made	no	sound.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't	 wear	 one	 of	 those	 baggy	 white	 suits	 that	 swished	 with	 movement.	 His clothing,	 though	 as	 white	 as	 the	 baggy	 suits,	 were	 more	 fitted.	 Only	 his	 thick, white	hair	covered	his	head,	and	he	wore	nothing	over	his	eyes.	Even	his	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	gloveless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 grey	 eyes	 darted	 around	 before	 he	 finally	 fixed	 his	 gaze	 on	 my	 face again.	There	was	something	about	him	that	made	me	feel	like	I'd	known	him	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 long	 time.	 It	 was	 much	 longer	 than	 what	 my	 memory	 suggested.	 He	 was someone	you	didn't	forget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	who	I	am?”	He	tilted	his	head	back	a	little	and	from	my	desk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	see	up	his	long,	pointed	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	though	I	recognized	him,	his	name	and	who	he	was,	did	not	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!”	 He	 nodded	 and	 took	 another	 step	 closer.	 The	 surveillance	 system hummed,	and	my	heart	quickened.	Beads	of	sweat	trickled	down	the	small	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	 The	 back	 of	 my	 throat	 tickled,	 as	 my	 nose	 caught	 some	 strange	 scent.	 I resisted	 the	 urge	 to	 lean	 forward	 and	 sniff,	 but	 there	 was	 no	 doubt	 the	 strong perfume	 came	 from	 him.	 It	 wasn't	 entirely	 unpleasant	 only	 too	 much,	 although there	was	something	familiar	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	 see	 how	 your	 studies	 are	 progressing.”	 He	 moved	 beside	 me	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">peered	over	my	shoulder	at	the	textbook	on	my	desk.	“Ah,	history.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again.	I	was	sure	my	heart	had	climbed	up	my	throat	and	was	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	pop	out	of	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	see.”	He	pushed	me	and	my	chair	out	of	his	way,	and	I	bumped	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	foot	of	my	bed.	He	reached	over	with	his	long,	bony	fingers	and	flipped	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	next	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 swallowed	 the	 thickened	 spit	 in	 my	 mouth;	 my	 eyes	 fixed	 on	 his	 every move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	a	little	bit	of	a	history	buff	myself.	Well…	truth	be	told,”	he	turned	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	 away	 from	 the	 book	 and	 looked	 at	 me,	 “I'm	 pretty	 much	 a	 buff	 at everything.”	He	chuckled	for	a	second	before	a	crooked	grin	took	its	place.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	have	a	lot	in	common.	Well,	I	must	go.	Nice	talking	 <i class="calibre3">at</i>	you.”	He	turned	on his	heel	and	headed	back	toward	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	first	time,	I	noticed	someone	by	the	entrance,	dressed	in	full	white-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>blob	mode.	He	stood	back	from	the	door,	and	when	it	slid	open,	he	followed	the white-haired	man	out	the	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	exhaled	a	huge	breath,	resisting	the	urge	to	fan	the	air	with	my	hand.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders	dropped	in	relief,	and	my	heart	crept	back	into	place.	I	returned	to	my textbook,	grabbed	the	note	and	envelope,	and	stuffed	them	down	the	front	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Why	had	he	come	into	my	room? </i>	I	flipped	the	page	of	my	text	and	pretended to	read.	Confusing	thoughts	filled	my	head.	I	couldn't	concentrate	on	my	work, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	couldn't	stop	either.	I	had	to	keep	pretending	until	study	time	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grabbed	 my	 yellow	 highlighter	 and	 picked	 a	 few	 sentences.	 Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance	was	of	no	concern	to	me.	I	hadn't	read	a	single	word	on	the	page.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">flipped	another	page,	mindless	in	my	actions.	My	eyes	stared	at	the	words,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	nothing.	The	urge,	to	leave	my	desk	grew	stronger.	The	strict	regimen	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	in	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instant	relief	came	in	the	form	of	a	ringing	bell,	and	all	the	muscles	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	relaxed	as	the	tension	eased.	I	closed	my	eyes	and	exhaled	through	pursed</p>
<p class="calibre1">lips.	 The	 unmistakable	 sound	 of	 the	 dumbwaiter	 filled	 my	 ears,	 and	 I	 turned around.	I	had	never	looked	so	forward	to	my	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hesitated	 before	 I	 reached	 in	 and	 pulled	 the	 small	 tray	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment.	 My	 thoughts	 drifted	 to	 earlier	 events,	 and	 for	 a	 moment,	 the procedure	was	forgotten.	I	placed	the	tray	on	the	table	and	pulled	the	lid	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moment	the	buzzing	reached	my	ears	my	stomach	dropped.	I	had	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	mistake.	It	was	all	I	had	time	to	think	before	the	flash	of	blue	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	myself	up	off	the	floor;	my	legs	shook	under	my	weight.	I	managed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	climb	into	my	chair,	folded	my	arms	on	the	top	of	the	table,	and	I	rested	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	 The	 smell	 of	 singed	 hair	 was	 in	 my	 nose.	 I	 inhaled	 and	 filled	 my	 lungs several	 times	 before	 rising	 on	 shaky	 legs	 and	 made	 my	 way	 over	 to	 the washroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	red	apple	stared	up	at	me	from	the	tray	as	the	bathroom	door	clicked	closed</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	me.	I	had	no	appetite	but	couldn't	afford	to	face	any	more	consequences</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	didn't	eat.	My	feet	dragged	me	back	toward	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Was	his	visit	my	surprise? </i>	I	bit	into	the	sweet	red	orb	as	I	remembered.  <i class="calibre3">Some</i> <i class="calibre3">surprise! </i>	I	bit	again,	but	my	teeth	sunk	in	too	far,	and	I	ended	up	with	a	mouthful of	seeds.

<p class="calibre1">I	 didn't	 hear	 him	 enter.	 I	 stared	 wide-eyed	 at	 his	 baggy	 white	 figure.	 For	 a moment,	his	brown	eyes	stared	back	at	me	as	he	stood	in	the	entrance.	I	finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">broke	contact	with	his	gaze	and	looked	at	the	chair	he	held	as	he	walked	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	across	from	where	I	sat.	“Remember,	do	not	respond	as	I	speak	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,”	 a	 voice	 floated	 from	 behind	 the	 mask.	 It	 was	 soft,	 yet	 deep	 with	 an unfamiliar	accent,	and	it	was	most	certainly	male. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 set	 the	 chair	 down	 by	 the	 table,	 and	 we	 went	 about	 our	 business	 as though	the	other	weren't	in	the	room.	I	wiped	the	juice	from	my	chin	and	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	bite	from	my	apple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	ears	pricked	to	the	sound	of	the	door;	J	had	left	the	room.  <i class="calibre3">What	kind	of	a</i> <i class="calibre3">surprise	is	another	chair? </i>	I	stared	at	the	other	chair,	an	exact	copy	of	my	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	alerted	me	again,	and	J	came	back	in	with	a	bed	he	rolled	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	not	follow	me	with	your	eyes,”	he	warned	as	he	pushed	the	bed	past	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	click	of	the	locks	on	the	wheels	rang	in	my	ears.	I	wanted	to	turn	around	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">J	 came	 into	 view	 again	 and	 left	 the	 room.	 Minutes	 passed.	 I	 finished	 my apple	and	placed	the	remnants	on	the	plate	with	the	seeds	I'd	spat	out	earlier.	I replaced	 the	 lid	 on	 the	 tray	 and	 pushed	 the	 whole	 thing	 into	 the	 waiting dumbwaiter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	soon	as	I	stood	up	from	the	table,	the	door	slid	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	going	about	your	business,”	J	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	peeked	out	the	corner	of	my	eye	and	saw	two	figures	enter	the	room.	The</p>

<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 the	 water	 shut	 off.	 I	 dried	 my	 hands,	 and	 I	 was	 free	 to	 leave.	 I stepped	toward	the	door	and	pulled	it	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 girl	 sat	 on	 a	 bed	 at	 the	 far	 end	 of	 the	 room.	 Like	 me,	 she	 had	 shoulder-length,	brown	hair,	though	hers	was	wavier	and	darker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	alarm	sounded,	and	I	hurried	out	from	the	washroom.	The	door	clicked</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	girl	looked	to	be	younger,	but	not	by	much.	J	stood	at	the	head	of	her</p>

<p class="calibre1">My	lips	parted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph!	What	kind	of	surprise	is	that?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">It	took	every	ounce	of	self-control	not	to	push	myself	away	from	my	desk	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	understand	your	disbelief,	but	trust	me,	you	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Trust	you? </i>	I	closed	my	eyes	for	a	second	and	took	a	deep	breath.	“Why	don't I	remember?	Why	doesn't	she	say	anything?”	I	released	my	grip	from	the	desk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	colour	returned	to	my	aching	knuckles.	I	flipped	a	page	of	my	text.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears	pricked	up	at	the	sound	of	the	camera.	The	thought	of	picking	up	my	book</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	launching	it	at	the	intrusive	piece	of	equipment	crossed	my	mind.	Instead,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">flipped	another	page,	not	caring	it	was	too	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	is	in	somewhat	of	a	hypnotic	state,	a	trance,	if	you	will.	She	has	muscle</p>

<p class="calibre1">She	can	process	information	and	learn,	but	she	is	mute	with	no	memory	of	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	in	the	past	–	she	just	exists.	Much	like	you	did	until	recently.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyelids	fluttered.  <i class="calibre3">What	is	he	talking	about? </i>	“I	don't	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	sighed.	“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 jumped	 a	 little	 at	 the	 sound	 of	 his	 voice	 as	 he	 stood	 behind	 me.	 I	 hadn't even	heard	him	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 am	 going	 to	 introduce	 you	 now	 –	 merely	 a	 formality,”	 he	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember,	they	are	watching.”	He	placed	his	ungloved	hand	on	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	warmth	of	his	touch	radiated	down	my	arm;	the	sensation	was	strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!”	 I	 stopped	 him	 before	 he	 turned	 me	 around.	 “Why	 are	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">introducing	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	Cecil's	idea.	He	does	not	know	you	are	becoming	aware,	so	he	does</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	think	the	two	of	you	becoming	roommates	will	be	a	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Questions	 filled	 my	 head,	 and	 I	 didn't	 know	 which	 to	 ask	 first.	 In	 the	 end, there	 were	 so	 many	 they	 overwhelmed	 me,	 and	 I	 didn't	 ask	 a	 single	 one.	 He turned	me	around,	the	camera	hummed,	and	I	was	silenced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	sat	on	her	bed.	Her	focus	was	straight	ahead	on	the	wall	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	J	pushed	me	toward	her	in	my	desk	chair	and	placed	me	in	her	line	of	vision</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	 our	 knees	 almost	 touched.	 I	 stared	 at	 the	 girl,	 but	 she	 didn't	 see	 me,	 only looked	right	through	me	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>J	moved	beside	me,	his	back	to	the	camera.	“Remember	do	not	react	in	any way.	They	think	you	are	still	in	a	hypno-state.”	The	sound	of	the	ever-watchful</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye	came	from	behind	him,	but	I	couldn't	see	it.	J's	body	had	blocked	it	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	they	know,”	I	said	in	my	best	ventriloquist	voice.	I	kept	my	focus	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	girl	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-why	do	you	say	that?”	J's	voice	faltered	and	gave	away	his	shock	at	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	before	you	came,	I	had	a	visitor,	and	I	nodded	when	he	asked	me	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">question.”	I	studied	the	girl's	features.	They	did	look	a	little	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	intensity	in	J's	voice	made	me	jump,	and	my	concentration	on	the	girl's</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	broke.	I	closed	my	eyes	and	pictured	the	man	in	my	room.	His	white	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	the	first	thing	that	came	to	mind.	“White	hair,”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 sucked	 in	 a	 large	 gulp	 of	 air.	 I	 turned	 my	 head	 and	 looked	 at	 him.	 His brown	eyes	had	narrowed	in	a	thoughtful	way.	“It	is	fine	you	nodded	to	him.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	 would	 be	 the	 only	 one	 to	 elicit	 that	 sort	 of	 response.	 I	 overheard	 once	 it had	something	to	do	with	a	song.	Anyway,	he	would	expect	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A	song? </i>	I	questioned	for	a	moment	and	in	the	same	instant	forgot	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	body	relaxed,	surprising	me.	I	didn't	think	I	had	been	holding	any	tension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 loud	 buzz	 filled	 the	 air.	 I	 stood	 up	 from	 my	 chair	 and	 pushed	 it	 back toward	the	desk.	My	body	reacted	before	my	brain	even	registered	the	reason	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	alarm.	I	cleaned	up	my	desk	and	put	my	book	away.	The	note	and	envelope</p>
<p class="calibre1">poked	at	the	skin	between	my	breasts	as	I	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 I	 do	 with	 your	 note?”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 feigned	 straightening	 and cleaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	it	back	in	the	laundry	chute.	I	will	retrieve	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 even	 thinking,	 my	 feet	 transported	 me	 from	 my	 desk	 and	 back</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	 my	 dresser.	 My	 body	 continued	 following	 procedures	 as	 much	 as	 my brain	tried	to	resist.	The	video	camera	whined	behind	me,	but	it	wasn't	its	eye	I sensed	 on	 the	 back	 of	 my	 head.	 I	 pulled	 open	 the	 bottom	 drawer	 and	 removed the	package	of	gym	clothes.	“Who	is	he?	The	white-haired	man?”	My	hands	tore</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	plastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	is	Cecil.	He	runs	this	centre.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	for	a	moment,	the	vision	of	the	word	C.E.C.I.L	flashed	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 eyes.	 “It's	 on	 the	 wall.”	 My	 hands	 freed	 the	 green	 t-shirt	 and	 shorts	 from their	confines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 is	 the	 name	 of	 this	 place.	 At	 least	 it	 is	 now.”	 The	 last	 bit	 he	 said	 more under	his	breath	as	though	speaking	a	thought	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>Another	 alarm	 buzzed,	 interrupting	 our	 conversation.	 I	 turned	 around,	 and for	 the	 first	 time	 since	 entering	 my	 room,	 the	 girl	 in	 blue	 had	 climbed	 off	 her bed.	J	guided	her	toward	the	desk,	and	she	sat	down.	The	laundry	chute	door	slid</p>
<p class="calibre1">open,	and	J	moved	toward	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	better	put	your	gym	clothes	on,”	he	said	as	he	reached	inside	the	chute</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	pulled	out	a	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	away	from	him	and	unbuttoned	my	dress.	I	pulled	it	over	my	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 laid	 it	 out	 on	 my	 bed.	 My	 eyes	 caught	 sight	 of	 the	 note	 and	 envelope peeking	out	from	my	bra.	I	tugged	my	t-shirt	over	my	head,	reached	inside,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoothed	out	the	papers	the	best	I	could.	Satisfied	they	would	not	be	visible,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	on	my	shorts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 is	 C.E.C.I.L?”	 I	 thought	 of	 the	 word	 engraved	 into	 the	 wall	 as	 I straightened	out	my	dress	on	my	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Contagion	Eradication	Centre	for	Intelligent	Life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stood	 up	 straight,	 abandoning	 my	 dress.	 My	 confusion	 cleared.	 “It's	 both his	name	and	this	place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph.	It	is.	We	must	leave	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	back	stiffened.	Something	in	his	tone	told	me	there	was	much	more	to	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	that.	“What	do	I	do	with	her?”	I	reached	out	and	smoothed	another	wrinkle</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	my	dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.”	J's	voice	was	flat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	and	followed	J	toward	the	door.	It	slid	open;	we	walked	out	and	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	girl	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a><b class="calibre4">Four	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">B20130623L</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	with	its	usual	airy	sound.	I	entered	my	room	and	pulled	at	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">t-shirt,	 glued	 to	 me	 with	 sweat,	 and	 stepped	 into	 the	 washroom.	 The	 mirror	 on the	wall	captured	my	attention.	I	stared	at	my	flushed	and	sweat	soaked	face.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	hung	in	limp	strands,	damp	and	tangled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 my	 wet	 shirt	 over	 my	 head.	 The	 smell	 of	 perspiration	 caused	 my nose	 to	 wrinkle.	 My	 shorts	 and	 underwear	 clung	 to	 my	 legs	 as	 I	 worked	 at sliding	 them	 down.	 When	 I'd	 finally	 stepped	 out	 of	 them,	 I	 stood	 back	 up.	 My reflection	showed	the	dampened	papers	sticking	out	from	my	bra.	I	unhooked	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 let	 it	 all	 fall	 to	 the	 floor	 in	 a	 heap	 with	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 wet	 clothing.	 My shower	would	be	brief	as	it	was	almost	time	for	lunch.	My	stomach	rumbled	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	 fresh	 and	 dry,	 I	 picked	 up	 my	 clothing	 and	 the	 note	 from	 the	 floor and	opened	the	door.	The	warning	bell	followed	me	out	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sight	 of	 her	 sitting	 at	 my	 desk	 surprised	 me.	 I	 had	 almost	 forgotten about	my	new	roommate.	It	was	difficult	trying	to	keep	my	focus	in	front	of	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	crossed	the	room.	I	wanted	to	watch	the	new	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hesitated	before	depositing	my	clothes	and	the	note	into	the	laundry	chute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	damp	clothing	had	been	my	only	protection,	and	now	I	had	nothing.	I	drew</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	sharp	breath	as	I	stood	in	the	far	corner	of	the	room	under	the	ever-watchful eye.	Naked	-	I	gasped.  <i class="calibre3">How	 had	 I	 ever	 done	 this	 before? </i>	 The	 thought	 came	 to me	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 walked	 toward	 my	 dresser,	 all	 the	 while	 I	 told myself	 to	 act	 as	 though	 clothed.  <i class="calibre3">I	 hadn't	 cared	 before, </i>	 I	 thought,	 as	 my	 hands pulled	 a	 packaged	 set	 of	 underwear	 from	 the	 drawer.	 But	 before,	 I	 hadn't	 quite been	 myself,	 though	 I	 wasn't	 sure	 if	 I	 was	 now.	 It	 was	 like	 waking	 up	 from	 a dream,	in	that	state	where	you	aren't	asleep	but	aren't	awake	either.	I	was	stuck somewhere	in	the	middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed	 as	 I	 pulled	 on	 my	 dress	 and	 sat	 on	 my	 bed.	 I	 stared	 at	 the dumbwaiter	and	waited	for	the	door	to	open.	When	it	came	seconds	later,	I	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	traipsed	to	my	chair.	The	girl	walked	to	the	washroom	and	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	tray	in	the	compartment	was	labeled	B20130623L.	It	was	her	tray. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Do	 they	 call	 her	 B2? </i>	 I	 placed	 the	 tray	 on	 the	 table.	 A	 moment	 later	 the dumbwaiter	 opened	 again.	 I	 reached	 in	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 tray	 labelled	 with	 my ID. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl,	B2	I'd	decided,	returned	to	the	table	and	took	her	seat	across	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	I	stared	at	her	and	her	blank	eyes	for	a	moment.  <i class="calibre3">Did	I	look	like	that?	Did	my</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a> <i class="calibre3">eyes	 look	 as	 though	 they	 saw	 nothing? </i>	 A	 shiver	 ran	 through	 my	 body	 as	 I wondered	about	my	previous	trance-like	state.	I	pulled	my	lid	from	my	tray	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	to	eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	 finished	 her	 meal	 before	 me	 and	 placed	 her	 empty	 tray	 back	 in	 the dumbwaiter.  <i class="calibre3">Did	she	even	taste	her	food? </i>	I	looked	down	at	the	few	bites	still	on my	 plate	 and	 devoured	 them.	 I	 was	 suddenly	 afraid	 to	 arouse	 suspicious	 if	 I didn't	behave	like	B2. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">For	days	I	followed	B2's	lead,	acting	as	she	did,	but	it	was	getting	difficult	with each	passing	moment.	I	was	growing	tired	of	the	act,	tired	of	the	procedures,	and tired	of	B2.	The	expression	“<i class="calibre3">bored	to	death</i>”	popped	into	my	head	like	so	many other	 things.	 I	 wasn't	 sure	 if	 it	 was	 based	 on	 truth.	 If	 it	 wasn't,	 I	 was	 close	 to actually	being	boredom's	first	victim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	day,	flashes	of	moments	from	the	past	flickered	in	my	mind	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">bits	of	a	hazy	dream.	Some	things	I	understood,	while	others	were	out	of	reach, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	couldn't	grasp	their	meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	had	begun	backing	off	on	the	memory	blocking/hypnotizing	drug	on	B2	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	first	day	she'd	moved	in.	But,	the	process	was	slow.	I'd	learned	it	had	taken almost	three	months	for	the	effects	to	begin	reversing	on	me.	I	was	still	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	from	being	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Restless	 sleep	 filled	 my	 nights.	 Strange	 dreams	 invaded	 the	 peace	 I	 had grown	 accustomed	 to.	 There	 was	 nothing	 that	 made	 sense	 and	 as	 the	 weeks passed	even	B2's	blank	gaze	began	haunting	my	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">B2	 and	 I	 sat	 at	 the	 table	 and	 waited	 for	 J	 to	 arrive.	 She	 gazed	 with	 her	 usual blank	 expression	 as	 I	 stared	 up	 at	 the	 light	 above	 the	 door.	 As	 it	 turned	 out,	 it wasn't	unusual	for	me	to	do	so,	and	so	I	continued.	The	light	flashed	red,	and	the door	 slid	 open	 with	 its	 familiar	 whoosh.	 J	 stepped	 inside	 and	 pushed	 his	 cart toward	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 at	 the	 array	 of	 syringes	 on	 the	 cart.	 J	 kept	 his	 head	 down	 as	 he prepared	 the	 needles	 and	 placed	 blue	 stickers	 on	 half	 of	 them.	 As	 usual,	 I	 got mine	first,	the	ones	without	any	labels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	still	giving	me	the	memory	blocker	slash	hypnotic	stuff?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 stuck	 the	 last	 unprepared	 syringe	 into	 a	 bottle	 and	 pulled	 back	 on	 the plunger.	Clear	liquid	seeped	inside.	He	stopped	it	as	it	reached	one	of	the	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines	marking	the	appropriate	dosage.	“Yes,”	he	said	as	he	pulled	it	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 give	 you	 an	 injection	 daily,	 if	 I	 stopped	 altogether,	 they	 would	 notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	was	flat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>“What	are	the	other	two?”	I	kept	my	focus	on	the	cart.	It	wasn't	clear	to	me how	 many	 injections	 I	 received	 on	 a	 daily	 basis	 as	 three	 syringes	 had	 been prepared	 for	 me	 this	 day.	 My	 head	 tilted	 back	 as	 though	 I	 looked	 at	 the	 light above	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	certainly	are	filled	with	questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	bored.”	I	was	careful	not	to	shrug	as	I	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 eyes	 wandered	 away	 from	 the	 door	 to	 J's	 face.	 His	 head	 bent	 over	 his work,	but	his	eyes	looked	upward,	and	our	gazes	met	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	the	alcohol	swab,”	J	said	as	he	rubbed	the	cold	and	damp	piece	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">gauze	over	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	He'd	never	explained	the	process	before,	and	listening	to	his	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested	me.	J	picked	up	the	first	syringe	with	a	small	amount	of	liquid	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 the	 memory	 block	 hypnosis	 drug	 –	 Cecil	 designed	 it.	 In	 its	 full strength,	it	keeps	the	patient	in	a	trance	with	no	memories	of	their	past.	A	small amount	must	be	administered	daily	to	keep	the	patient	in	that	state.	This	dosage, however,	 is	 much	 smaller	 and	 diluted.”	 The	 tip	 of	 the	 needle	 pierced	 my	 skin, and	 I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 for	 a	 second.	 “This	 one	 prevents	 menstruation	 for	 three months.”	He	poked	me	in	the	arm	again	with	the	new	syringe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	word	was	familiar.	I	looked	away	as	if	the	definition	of	the	word	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	found	floating	in	the	air.	“Oh!”	The	memory	came	to	mind.	That	was	a	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">needle	to	get.  <i class="calibre3">How	many	of	those	had	I	received? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 this	 one,”	 J	 stuck	 the	 needle	 into	 my	 shoulder,	 “is	 the	 booster	 to	 the vaccine	I	gave	you	the	other	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 tried	 to	 recall	 both	 the	 shot	 and	 the meaning	of	the	word	vaccine.	“Against	what?”	I	said	as	it	came	back	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	pressed	a	piece	of	gauze	on	my	shoulder	for	a	second	and	replaced	it	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandage.	“You	always	bleed	a	little.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	avoided	my	question,	and	so	I	tried	again.	“Vaccination	against	what?	Do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	get	one?”	My	voice	rose	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	you	need	to	be	concerned	about.	And	no,	not	for	the	last	year,”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	as	he	prepared	B2's	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	sat	motionless	as	J	injected	her	with	her	three	injections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	backed	her	off	her	block	a	little	more	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rubbed	at	the	creases	in	my	forehead,	“Why	are	you	dressed	like	that?	Are</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	sick	–	are	you?”	The	questions	blurted	from	my	mouth	without	thought,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	heart	picked	up	its	pace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 sighed	 through	 his	 mask.	 “You	 are	 not	 sick.	 I	 am	 not	 sick.	 The	 garb	 is merely	a	precaution.	Now,	I	must	go.”	J	finished	packing	up	his	cart	and	left	the room.	I	was	sure	he	had	not	told	me	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>We	 sat	 a	 few	 minutes	 longer;	 each	 of	 us	 stared	 off	 into	 space.	 While	 my brain	buzzed	with	thoughts	and	memories,	B2's	gaze	was	as	blank	as	ever.	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">tempted	to	wave	my	hand	in	front	of	her	face.	The	phrase	“<i class="calibre3">The	lights	are	on,	but</i> <i class="calibre3">nobody's	home</i>”	whispered	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Hours	 later	 we	 sat	 eating	 our	 dinner.	 Seated	 at	 the	 table	 was	 the	 only	 time	 my body	relaxed	as	the	camera	behind	me	focused	on	B2.	My	boredom	turned	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	little	child,	and	I	made	faces	at	B2	between	bites	of	food.	I	mimicked	her movements.	Head	down	–	take	a	bite	of	food,	head	up	–	chew.	Only	when	I	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 head	 up,	 I	 changed	 my	 expression.	 I	 fluttered	 my	 eyelids,	 stuck	 out	 my tongue,	 and	 puffed	 out	 my	 cheeks.	 Not	 a	 single	 face	 produced	 a	 reaction.	 B2's eyes	continued	their	blank	stare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed,	dinner	would	be	over	soon,	and	the	long	night	would	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	head	down	and	stared	at	my	last	bit	of	food	before	finally	placing	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	my	mouth.	In	unison,	we	tipped	our	heads	up	to	chew.	I	opened	my	mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide;	my	chewed	food	rested	on	my	tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	stared	at	my	open	mouth,	and	I	stared	back.	She	blinked.	The	dark	shades</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Children's	laughter	echoed	in	my	ears.	There	were	giggles	and	snorts	of	varied</i> <i class="calibre3">pitches	 –	 it	 was	 a	 kaleidoscope	 of	 sound.	 I	 looked	 down	 at	 my	 bare	 feet.	 Cool</i> <i class="calibre3">blades	 of	 lush,	 green	 grass	 stuck	 up	 between	 my	 little	 toes,	 warmed	 by	 the</i> <i class="calibre3">sunlight	 that	 bathed	 them.	 They	 wiggled,	 and	 the	 sparkles	 in	 my	 purple	 nail</i> <i class="calibre3">polish	 reflected	 the	 light	 like	 shining	 amethysts.	 I	 pulled	 my	 hands	 from	 the</i> <i class="calibre3">pockets	 of	 my	 shorts	 and	 looked	 at	 the	 nails	 on	 my	 fingers.	 Each	 nail	 was</i> <i class="calibre3">painted	a	different	bright	colour.	I	fanned	my	fingers,	and	the	colours	reminded</i> <i class="calibre3">me	of	a	rainbow	arcing	across	the	sky. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A	pair	of	smaller	hands	reached	up	and	grabbed	for	mine.	The	same	bright</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">coloured	nail	polish	decorated	the	fingernails	of	the	little	girl	standing	in	front	of</i> <i class="calibre3">me.	Wavy,	brown	shoulder-length	hair	framed	her	round	face.	Her	icy	blue	eyes</i> <i class="calibre3">beamed	at	me	as	giggles	shook	her	body	and	sputtered	out	through	her	pink	lips. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We	 spun	 around	 in	 Ring-Around-the-Rosie	 fashion.	 The	 yard	 whizzed	 by	 in	 a</i> <i class="calibre3">dizzying	 blur	 as	 we	 twirled	 faster	 and	 faster.	 I	 leaned	 back,	 tilted	 my	 head</i> <i class="calibre3">toward	the	sky,	and	closed	my	eyes. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Suddenly,	 our	 bodies	 sprawled	 out	 on	 the	 grass,	 but	 I	 couldn't	 remember</i> <i class="calibre3">how	we	got	there.	Had	our	spinning	dizzied	us	so	much	we	fell	down? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We	lay	on	our	backs	and	stared	up	at	the	bright,	blue	sky.	Our	imaginations</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">created	animals	and	other	things	from	the	fluffy	white	clouds.	I	reached	up	and</i> <i class="calibre3">pointed	out	the	shape	of	a	rabbit,	taking	note	my	hand	looked	much	larger	and</i> <i class="calibre3">older	than	it	had	earlier. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	found	myself	standing	once	again,	and	like	before,	with	no	recollection	on</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">how	I	ended	up	in	that	current	position.	A	bead	of	sweat	trickled	down	my	chest</i> <i class="calibre3">and	wound	its	way	down	the	front	of	my	purple	tank	top	and	between	my	breasts. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">To	my	surprise,	I	was	certain	I	didn't	have	those	small	lumps	moments	ago	when</i> <i class="calibre3">I'd	been	spinning	around.	My	hands	cupped	each	small	mound	and	pressed	them</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">lightly	toward	my	chest.	They	were	real.	I	shook	my	head	in	confused	disbelief. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 took	 a	 step	 forward;	 something	 pricked	 the	 underside	 of	 my	 foot.	 I</i> <i class="calibre3">immediately	looked	down	and	searched	for	the	cause.	Brown,	dried	grass	poked</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">up	 between	 my	 toes	 like	 little	 needles.	 I	 took	 another	 step.	 The	 sensation	 of</i> <i class="calibre3">breaking	and	crunching	grass	travelled	up	my	body	and	reached	my	ears.	I	was</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">certain	 there	 had	 been	 an	 audible	 crunch.	 My	 eyes	 scanned	 the	 ground	 and</i> <i class="calibre3">searched	for	any	evidence	of	the	lush	green	grass	I'd	been	standing	in	not	long</i> <i class="calibre3">ago. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	yellow	and	brown	hues	of	dying	and	dead	grass	met	my	wandering	eyes. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 squinted.	 “What's	 happened?”	 I	 whispered.	 My	 hand	 brushed	 away	 a	 damp</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a> <i class="calibre3">lock	of	hair	that	had	fallen	in	front	of	my	eyes	as	a	bead	of	sweat	dripped	from</i> <i class="calibre3">my	nose.	I	watched	as	it	fell	to	the	ground	in	slow	motion.	When	it	hit,	the	drop</i> <i class="calibre3">broke	and	splashed	on	a	few	blades	of	yellowed	grass.	I	stared	in	wonder	as	the</i> <i class="calibre3">blades	bent	and	moved	toward	the	tiny	amount	of	moisture.	I	crouched	down	and</i> <i class="calibre3">lifted	the	wilted	blade	with	the	tip	of	my	finger.	The	grass	would	need	much	more</i> <i class="calibre3">than	a	drop.	I	tilted	my	head	up	to	the	cloudless,	blue	sky.	The	blazing	sun	was</i> <i class="calibre3">hot	on	my	face. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">April!”	A	distant	voice	called	and	pulled	my	attention	away	from	the	sky.	I</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">rose	to	my	feet	and	looked	around.	Who	was	calling?	Who	was	being	called? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">April!”	It	was	her	voice,	the	girl	who	stood	beside	me.	She	looked	familiar, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">older	than	the	girl	I'd	spun	around	with,	but	younger	than	B2.	I	stared	at	her;	my</i> <i class="calibre3">lips	parted,	and	my	eyes	narrowed	again. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	girl	reached	out	and	touched	my	arm.	My	eyes	fell	on	her	warm	hand. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Beads	of	perspiration	glistened	in	my	arm	hair.	My	gaze	wandered	up	her	arm</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">and	 took	 in	 her	 round	 face.	 Her	 icy	 blue	 eyes	 widened	 as	 her	 grip	 tightened	 a</i> <i class="calibre3">little	on	my	arm.	Her	lips	parted. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What's	wrong,	April? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">My	 eyelids	 fluttered	 open	 in	 the	 dark,	 and	 my	 hand	 reached	 down	 toward	 my waist	and	pulled	the	sheet	up	to	my	chest.	B2's	soft	snore	from	across	the	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">entered	my	ears.	I	rolled	over,	pulled	the	sheet	up	to	my	shoulder,	and	faced	the wall.	The	surveillance	equipment	reminded	me	of	its	presence.	I	focused	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny	 leftovers	 of	 my	 dream.	 Piecing	 the	 senseless	 bits	 of	 information	 together with	the	hope	they'd	make	sense.	Each	scene	became	more	defined	as	I	put	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pieces	in	place.	I	pulled	my	right	hand	out	from	underneath	my	cheek	where	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 tucked	 and	 wiggled	 my	 fingers	 in	 the	 dark.  <i class="calibre3">Had	 my	 fingers	 and	 toes</i> <i class="calibre3">worn	such	bright	sparkling	colours? </i>	My	toes	wiggled	under	the	sheets	as	though blades	of	dried	grass	were	stuck	between	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	image	of	the	round-faced	girl	with	the	brown,	wavy	hair	came	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Was	she	B2? </i>	I	squeezed	my	eyes	shut	to	erase	the	picture	of	her	face.	A	distant voice	whispered	deep	inside	in	my	head.  <i class="calibre3">What	did	it	say? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 focused	 on	 the	 sound,	 on	 the	 word.	 The	 whispering	 voice	 grew	 louder	 as the	 memory	 forced	 its	 way	 out	 from	 the	 deepest	 part	 of	 my	 brain.  <i class="calibre3">Come	 on! </i>	 I willed.	Invisible	hands	reached	inside	my	head	and	pulled	the	voice	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	sprang	open.  <i class="calibre3">Was	my	name	April? </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Reawakening</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Morning	couldn't	come	soon	enough.	J	couldn't	come	soon	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hard	moving	through	the	procedures	like	I	was	nothing	-	like	I	merely</p>
<p class="calibre1">existed.	I	was	more	than	an	ID	number;	I	had	a	real	name.	A	name	I	remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	at	least	thought	I	had.	Only	J	could	help,	I	hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	at	the	table;	my	gaze	darted	from	left	to	right	as	B2's	fixed	straight</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead.	 The	 clarity	 I'd	 seen	 in	 B2's	 eyes	 had	 been	 fleeting.	 My	 restless	 feet wanted	to	tap	on	the	hard,	white	floor,	but	I	kept	them	still.	My	hands	rested	flat on	 the	 table	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 Once	 I	 caught	 the	 absent	 tapping	 of	 my	 finger	 but stopped	 it	 the	 second	 I	 noticed.	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 if	 I'd	 been	 doing	 it	 for	 long.	 My concentration	was	on	keeping	my	feet	still	and	watching	for	the	red	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	large	exhale	blew	out	between	my	lips	when	the	light	finally	glowed	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 muscles	 in	 my	 upper	 body	 relaxed	 as	 the	 door	 opened.	 I	 focused	 on	 the entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning.”	His	voice	boomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stiffened	and	held	my	breath.	It	was	him,	the	man	with	the	overpowering</p>
<p class="calibre1">scent	 and	 the	 white	 hair.	 The	 man	 I	 knew	 but	 didn't	 know	 at	 the	 same	 time	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil.	 J	 trudged	 in	 behind	 and	 pushed	 his	 cart	 through	 the	 door.	 He	 shot	 me	 a look.	I	understood	and	kept	my	gaze	fixed	straight	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	girls	have	a	good	sleep?”	Cecil	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	see	B2	nod	her	head,	and	so	I	did	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 good,”	 he	 said	 with	 a	 lilting	 voice.	 His	 heavy	 hand	 rested	 on	 my shoulder;	the	paper	robe	offered	little	protection	against	his	cold	touch.	My	skin prickled	 and	 tingles	 coursed	 up	 from	 my	 feet	 and	 out	 through	 the	 top	 of	 my head.	My	heart	thumped	in	my	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	focused	my	attention	straight	ahead	as	J	stood	in	his	usual	spot	at	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn't	see	what	he	was	doing,	but	my	ears	tuned	into	every	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me,  <i class="calibre3">sir</i>,”	J	said	in	a	tone	I'd	never	heard	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pressure	on	my	shoulder	eased.	The	smell	of	alcohol	stung	my	nose	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cold	swab	touched	my	skin.	My	shoulder	registered	the	sharp	jab	of	a	needle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	picked	up	its	pace	when	a	wave	of	numbness	travelled	over	my	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	time	for	thought	as	I	slipped	into	unconsciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	gasped	as	warmth	rained	down	on	my	head.	My	eyes	closed.	Fuzzy	memories</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	thoughts	teetered	on	the	verge	of	clarity.	Seconds	later,	they	bombarded	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	the	spray	of	water	from	the	shower	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stepped	 from	 the	 shower,	 allowing	 the	 blowers	 to	 dry	 me	 off.  <i class="calibre3">How	 long</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a> <i class="calibre3">had	I	been	gone? </i>	My	stomach	tightened	as	more	memories	came	rushing	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 stepped	 from	 the	 bathroom,	 B2	 was	 already	 seated	 at	 the	 table, waiting,	and	I	joined	her.	Thoughts	swirled	in	my	head.	My	last	memory	was	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting	 in	 my	 chair	 waiting	 for	 J	 to	 come	 into	 the	 room.	 I	 had	 something	 I	 had wanted	to	ask	him,	but	that	was	one	memory	I	couldn't	reach.	I	closed	my	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 a	 moment.	 When	 I	 opened	 them,	 the	 red	 light	 flashed,	 and	 J	 came	 into	 the room	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long?”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glad	 you	 are	 back.”	 J	 glanced	 at	 me	 for	 a	 moment;	 his	 eyes	 crinkled.	 He returned	his	attention	to	his	cart	and	went	back	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long?”	I	repeated	a	little	louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	has…”	he	wiped	and	poked	in	one	quick	motion,	“only	been	two	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	arm	jerked	a	little.	It	had	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	days?”	The	revelation	surprised	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	depends	on	how	you	look	at	it;	I	might	even	suggest	three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	think	my	eyes	could	open	any	further.	I	opened	my	mouth	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	does	not	seem	to	have	left	any	ill	effects.”	He	pressed	a	small	cotton	ball</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	injection	site. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	 <i class="calibre3">he</i>	come	every	day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 only	 that	 one	 time.	 The	 next	 day	 I	 dropped	 the	 dosage	 back	 down	 to what	you	had	been	getting.	It	was	a	bit	of	a	risk,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	There	was	a	sudden	flutter	in	my	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 your	 body	 went	 from	 having	 one	 full	 dose	 to	 about	 an	 eighth	 in	 a twenty-four-hour	period.”	He	stuck	a	bandage	on	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	risked	my	life?”	My	ears	burned	with	anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 paid	 no	 attention	 and	 continued	 to	 prepare	 B2's	 injection.	 “I	 only	 risked returning	your	complete	memory,	but	it	was	a	risk	I	had	to	take.	I	need	you	to	be aware	sooner	than	I	expected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	furrowed	my	brow.	“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things	are…”	he	paused	as	he	stuck	a	needle	into	B2's	arm.	Her	blank	gaze</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	she	never	registered	the	prick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	what?”	I	said.	My	patience	waned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 am	 not	 exactly	 sure	 what.	 But	 trust	 me	 when	 I	 tell	 you	 things	 are feeling	a	little	different.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	B2?”	I	said	as	I	stared	into	her	empty	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	backing	her	down	as	quickly	as	I	can.	It	is	far	riskier	for	her	to	go	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast.	 You	 had	 already	 been	 on	 a	 much	 lower	 dose	 for	 quite	 some	 time	 before	 I had	to	give	you	a	full	one	again.	Your	sister	on	the	other	hand…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">J's	 mention	 of	 the	 word	 sister	 sparked	 memories	 of	 brown	 grass,	 sparkling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>nail	polish,	and	a	round-faced	girl	calling	a	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	my	name	April?”	The	words	blurted	from	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 stopped	 cleaning	 his	 cart	 and	 stared	 at	 me	 for	 a	 moment.	 Clearly,	 I	 had asked	the	question	of	all	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 didn't	 answer.	 Instead,	 he	 finished	 cleaning	 up.	 Then	 he	 pushed	 the	 cart toward	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	beat	faster	as	the	burning	returned	to	my	ears.	“Is	my	name	April?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	again.	My	stomach	clenched	with	my	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	The	door	slid	open,	and	J	disappeared	along	with	his	clanging	cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><b class="calibre4">Seven	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Auto-pilot</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Wisps	of	hair	around	my	face	fluttered	in	the	breeze	created	by	the	sliding	door.	I stepped	inside	the	doorframe	and	looked	back	at	B2.	Her	body	hunched	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk	in	the	corner	as	she	worked	on	her	studies	like	a	programmed	robot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	followed	J	down	the	long,	white	corridor.	The	lights	hummed	and	flickered</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead.	 Cameras	 with	 red	 eyes	 tracked	 our	 progress	 down	 the	 corridor.	 We passed	several	doors	along	the	way,	none	of	which	gave	any	sign	as	to	what	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	them.	Thoughts	of	what,	or	who,	buzzed	through	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	turned	right,	and	I	followed.	We	had	made	this	trek	several	times	a	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	focused	on	the	empty	hall,	a	fact	that	I	only	noticed	in	recent	days.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	no	one	and,	apart	from	the	humming	lights,	there	was	no	other	sound	but	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">echo	of	our	footfalls.	I	concentrated	and	thought	back	to	my	other	trips	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corridor.	No	memory	existed	that	showed	any	contact	with	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 a	 single	 picture	 adorned	 the	 walls	 to	 add	 colour	 to	 the	 starkness.	 The floor	 was	 as	 hard	 and	 white	 as	 the	 one	 in	 my	 room,	 the	 corridor	 a	 long,	 white tunnel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	stopped	and	stepped	to	the	side.	A	glass	door	marked	the	end	of	the	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall	and	stood	about	ten	feet	away.	The	glass	entrance	glowed	with	bright,	warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">light.	It	differed	from	the	light	in	the	hall	in	that	it	was	not	as	sterile.	I	stepped forward	and	walked	past	J,	my	steps	hesitant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	not	look	back	at	me.”	J's	voice	cautioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 back	 stiffened.	 I	 continued	 forward,	 pushed	 open	 the	 glass	 door,	 and stepped	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bright	 light	 stung	 my	 eyes	 for	 a	 moment,	 and	 I	 squinted	 and	 blinked until	they	adjusted.	I	inhaled	the	fresh	air	and	stretched	my	arms	above	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 heart	 skipped,	 and	 I	 allowed	 them	 to	 fall	 back	 down	 to	 my	 sides.  <i class="calibre3">Should	 I</i> <i class="calibre3">have	done	that? </i>	My	body	tensed.	I	closed	my	eyes	for	a	moment.  <i class="calibre3">It's	too	late	to</i> <i class="calibre3">worry	now. </i>	I	opened	them	and	exhaled	the	worry	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed.	 I	 wasn't	 outside	 but	 in	 an	 expansive	 room	 designed	 to	 mimic	 the outdoors.	Sunlamps	hung	from	the	sky-blue	ceiling.	Their	heat	warmed	the	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	head.	White,	puffy	clouds	hung	from	the	rafters	to	complete	the	look.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut	stone	path	meandered	through	the	imitation	grass.	Colourful,	plastic	flowers</p>
<p class="calibre1">poked	out	in	a	random	pattern.	Tall,	artificial	trees	stretched	up	toward	the	fake sky.	 Somewhere	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 room	 the	 name	 C.E.C.I.L	 was	 etched into	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stood	 still	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 simulated	 outdoor	 landscape	 in	 front	 of	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murals	 of	 mountains	 and	 forests	 made	 it	 look	 like	 the	 room	 never	 ended.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>closed	my	eyes	and	inhaled	again.	Even	the	air	smelled	fresh.	It	was,	in	fact,	the only	thing	that	was	real,	piped	in	from	outside.	According	to	J,	it	was	the	newest feature,	added	only	several	days	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 hesitation	 lasted	 only	 a	 moment,	 and	 when	 I	 opened	 my	 eyes,	 I	 began my	 walk.	 Bird	 songs,	 buzzing	 insects,	 and	 the	 whisper	 of	 something	 else resounded	 through	 the	 pretend	 forest.	 I	 stepped	 inside	 the	 tree	 line.	 Rustling leaves	caused	me	to	tilt	my	head	back.	The	treetops	swayed	in	a	gentle	motion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed	around	by	fans	high	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	walk	would	lead	me	through	the	artificial	forest	ten	times.	It	would	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 about	 twenty	 minutes	 to	 complete.	 The	 entire	 journey	 measured	 over	 a kilometre	and	a	half	or	just	under	a	mile.	An	illuminated	sign	at	the	beginning	of the	trail	documented	the	distance	and	number	of	every	loop	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wanted	 to	 stop	 and	 investigate	 the	 forest	 surrounding	 me,	 but	 to	 do	 so would	only	alert	them	of	my	awareness.	Despite	the	real	outdoor	look,	many	red</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	tracked	my	every	movement.	My	curiosity	would	have	to	be	satisfied	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">images	my	eyes	captured.	Every	once	in	a	while	I	found	my	pace	slowing;	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	remind	myself	to	walk	as	though	I	didn't	care	about	my	surroundings.	Relief</p>
<p class="calibre1">washed	over	me	when	the	number	ten	lit	up	on	the	sign.	Each	loop	had	shown</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	things	I	hadn't	noticed	before	and	tempted	me	to	leave	the	trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 off	 the	 path	 that	 wound	 its	 way	 around	 the	 perimeter	 and	 headed down	 another.	 The	 trail	 would	 break	 free	 from	 the	 forest	 and	 lead	 me	 into	 a clearing	 in	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 room.	 In	 this	 area,	 stations	 were	 set	 up	 for	 the various	exercises	I	had	to	complete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 I'd	 ever	 managed	 the	 monotony	 before	 was	 unimaginable,	 but	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 before	 I	 hadn't	 been	 aware	 of	 it.	 I	 went	 through	 the	 motions	 without thought	 or	 emotion.	 There	 wasn't	 one	 station	 I	 enjoyed.	 After	 a	 few	 minutes,	 I left	 one	 post	 and	 moved	 on	 to	 the	 next.	 Each	 area	 was	 timed	 and	 monitored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 completing	 one	 circuit,	 I	 started	 again.	 It	 ended	 when	 the	 number	 five appeared	on	another	illuminated	sign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hot	and	sweaty	from	my	exercises,	I	moved	back	to	the	forest	trail	for	a	final</p>
<p class="calibre1">lap	and	my	cool	down.	It	was	the	lap	I	enjoyed	the	most;	plodding	around	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 engrained	 into	 my	 head.	 The	 slower	 pace	 allowed	 for	 me	 to	 absorb	 the phoney	 sights	 much	 easier	 than	 before.	 Small	 crevices	 inside	 trees	 caught	 my attention	and	urged	me	to	explore	them,	but	I	did	not	veer	off	the	path.	Instead,	I continued	my	observations	from	afar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 heart	 skipped	 a	 little	 as	 a	 thought	 entered	 my	 mind.  <i class="calibre3">Do	 I	 dare? </i>	 I	 was approaching	 a	 large	 rock	 that	 sat	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 trail.	 I	 had	 perceived	 it	 as real,	but	I	couldn't	be	sure.	I	allowed	my	steps	to	move	me	closer	to	the	edge	of the	path	as	I	neared.	The	boulder	was	only	feet	away.	My	left	hand	hung	at	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>side.	 Another	 few	 steps	 and	 I	 would	 be	 walking	 close	 enough	 for	 my	 hand	 to brush	up	against	it	and	satisfy	my	curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	raced	as	my	thoughts	wrestled	back	and	forth.	I	stretched	out	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiggling	 fingers.  <i class="calibre3">Just	 a	 few	 more	 steps, </i>	 my	 mind	 whispered.	 A	 bead	 of	 sweat trickled	down	my	lower	back.	The	anticipation	was	growing	as	I	made	the	final</p>
<p class="calibre1">approach;	my	pulse	quickened.	As	I	passed	by,	my	fingers	curled	back	into	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	My	fists	clenched	at	my	sides,	and	I	finished	my	stroll.	I	exhaled	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursed	lips,	relieved	and	disappointed	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">J	was	waiting	where	I'd	left	him	and	led	me	back	to	my	room.	The	door	opened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	was	cleaning	up	her	desk,	and	I	stepped	into	our	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	a	good	day.”	J's	voiced	called	out	before	the	door	slid	closed	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 headed	 to	 the	 bathroom	 and	 continued	 my	 mechanical	 routine.	 My	 auto-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot	life	needed	to	end.	I	was	about	to	lose	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a><b class="calibre4">Eight	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Recognition</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 lay	 on	 my	 side	 and	 stared	 up	 at	 the	 camera	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 room.	 Its watchful	red	eye	focused	on	B2	as	she	made	her	bed.	It	would	be	several	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	 before	 it	 turned	 its	 attention	 to	 me.	 B2	 headed	 to	 the	 bathroom	 and continued	her	morning	routine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 every	 second	 passed,	 I	 found	 it	 increasingly	 difficult	 to	 keep	 up	 the façade	of	a	robotic	state.	I'd	figured	out	the	surveillance	equipment	focused	on	us at	different	times.	When	B2	rose	from	bed	a	half	hour	before	me,	it	spent	its	time watching	her	and	ignored	me	like	I	wasn't	even	in	the	room.	I	grew	brave	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	even	wave	at	it,	but	it	never	wandered	away	from	B2	as	she	stood	by	her	bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 made	 it.	 During	 those	 several	 minutes,	 the	 time	 was	 mine.	 I	 could	 do whatever	I	wanted	in	my	corner	of	the	room,	and	the	intrusive	equipment	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	 me	 alone.	 I	 learned	 to	 steal	 several	 moments	 during	 the	 day,	 moments	 I would	use	for	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stood	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 room	 underneath	 the	 ever-watchful	 eye.	 For	 all	 it knew,	I	was	piling	my	laundry	into	the	chute.	I	pressed	my	back	into	the	painted, concrete	 wall	 and	 let	 myself	 slide	 down	 to	 the	 floor.	 By	 the	 time	 I	 reached	 the white	ceramic,	my	dress	had	risen	and	exposed	my	lower	back.	I	did	nothing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fix	it;	the	coolness	of	the	wall	was	pleasant	on	my	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	was	over	by	my	–	now	our	–	dresser,	and	she	removed	some	clothing	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 set	 of	 fresh	 bedding.	 It	 was	 a	 task	 the	 camera	 found	 more	 entertaining	 than trying	to	see	my	actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 the	 folded	 piece	 of	 paper	 from	 the	 front	 of	 my	 dress.	 My	 hands smoothed	it	out	on	the	hard	floor.	I	reached	into	one	of	my	pockets	and	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	a	shortened	pencil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	discovered	or	remembered	I	enjoyed	drawing.	It	was	as	natural	for	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">draw	 as	 it	 was	 to	 breathe.	 Every	 day	 I	 worked	 on	 my	 illustration	 for	 a	 few minutes.	It	was	a	face	I	couldn't	get	out	of	my	mind,	though	I	had	no	recollection of	whose	it	was.	My	memory	shared	small	fragments	of	the	image	in	my	dreams, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	collage	of	blurred	features	that	made	no	sense.	I	sorted	through	the	pieces	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	in	my	head	and	used	those	bits	that	were	the	sharpest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	most	recent	dream	had	given	me	another	clue.	The	brief	flash	of	the	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	to	me	again	behind	closed	lids.	My	eyelids	fluttered	back	open	to	the	faint</p>
<p class="calibre1">pencilled	 outline	 of	 an	 oval	 shape.	 Hair	 and	 indiscernible	 features	 stared	 up	 at me	from	the	wrinkled	sheet	of	lined	paper.	The	details	were	rough.	There	was	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	 if	 the	 face	 was	 male	 or	 female,	 young	 or	 old,	 but	 I	 was	 determined	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>make	that	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gripped	 the	 pencil	 and	 began	 working	 on	 the	 eyes.	 They	 were	 the	 only thing	that	had	stood	out	from	my	dream.	I	couldn't	remember	the	exact	colour, </p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 that	 they	 were	 light.	 Thick,	 long	 lashes	 framed	 them,	 and	 they	 twinkled with	happiness.	I	made	sure	to	capture	the	emotion	in	my	sketch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 whirring	 of	 the	 video	 equipment	 interrupted	 me.	 It	 had	 turned	 toward the	wall	as	far	as	it	could.	I	jumped	to	my	feet,	folded	my	drawing,	and	tucked	it back	inside	the	front	of	my	dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 trudged	 back	 to	 the	 dresser	 for	 clean	 bedding.	 As	 I	 made	 my	 bed,	 I removed	 the	 drawing	 and	 tucked	 it	 under	 the	 fitted	 sheet.	 The	 hair	 rose	 on	 the back	of	my	neck	as	though	a	pair	of	eyes	glared	at	me.	I	wanted	to	turn	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	glare	back	at	the	camera.	My	pulse	quickened,	and	my	face	warmed	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought.	I	let	out	my	breath.	“No,	I	won't,”	I	whispered	to	the	wall	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bathroom	 had	 also	 become	 a	 place	 where	 I	 could	 do	 what	 I	 wanted.	 I'd learned	 that	 I	 could	 go	 a	 day	 without	 a	 shower	 and	 use	 the	 time	 for	 drawing instead.	 I	 looked	 forward	 to	 those	 days.	 My	 twelve	 minutes	 of	 bathroom	 prep time	dropped	to	about	two,	and	I	had	a	full	ten	minutes	at	my	leisure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn't	long	before	more	detail	filled	in	my	sketch,	and	the	face	of	a	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy	 emerged	 on	 the	 wrinkled	 paper.	 The	 creases	 had	 distorted	 the	 image somewhat,	despite	my	careful	folding.	Unfortunately,	it	wasn't	enough	to	protect</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	drawing.	It	was	only	about	a	week	and	a	half	old,	but	the	wear	made	it	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	older	than	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	studied	the	smeared	pencilled	features,	the	full	cheeks	and	laughing	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	 he	 remained	 anonymous.	 I	 shut	 mine	 and	 focused	 on	 the	 blackness	 behind my	lids	as	I	tried	to	get	a	clearer	image	in	my	mind.  <i class="calibre3">Who	are	you? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	alarm	sounded,	and	I	was	forced	to	fold	the	drawing	up	once	gain	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tuck	 it	 between	 my	 breasts.	 I	 pulled	 on	 my	 paper	 robe.	 With	 B2	 sharing	 the room,	J	now	arrived	after	my	morning	shower	time	instead	of	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 quick	 look	 in	 the	 mirror	 showed	 I	 did	 not	 look	 as	 though	 I'd	 had	 a	 hot shower.	I	dragged	a	wet	brush	through	my	hair	and	pinched	my	cheeks	until	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">flushed	red.	I	scrubbed	my	teeth	with	a	wet	finger	and	swished	water	I'd	drank</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 tap,	 around	 my	 mouth.	 I	 pulled	 the	 robe	 tighter	 around	 my	 body	 and exited	the	room	just	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	sat	at	the	table,	and	I	joined	her,	the	image	of	the	boy's	face	still	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	J	entered	the	room,	I	couldn't	wait	to	show	him	the	picture.	My	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">thumped,	and	I	was	sure	it	rustled	both	the	paper	robe	and	the	drawing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	something	to	show	you,”	I	whispered	in	a	somewhat	shaky	voice	as	J</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>prepared	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.”	His	eyebrows	rose,	but	he	didn't	look	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 right	 arm	 rested	 on	 the	 table	 in	 front	 of	 me	 like	 it	 always	 did.	 All	 I needed	 to	 do	 was	 reach	 between	 the	 folds	 of	 my	 paper	 attire	 and	 pull	 the drawing	 out	 from	 underneath.	 But,	 I	 was	 afraid	 any	 movement	 I	 made	 would catch	the	attention	of	whoever	watched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	under	my	robe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 pulled	 the	 protective	 red	 cap	 from	 the	 needle.	 It	 slipped	 from	 his	 fingers and	 fell	 to	 the	 floor	 with	 a	 light	 tap.	 He	 placed	 the	 syringe	 back	 on	 his	 cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oops!”	he	said,	as	he	moved	behind	me.	“You	can	take	it	out	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	peeled	back	the	fold	of	my	robe	and	eased	out	the	paper.	It	was	difficult, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 I	 managed	 to	 unfold	 it	 with	 one	 hand.	 All	 the	 while	 J	 positioned	 himself between	me	and	the	camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay?”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 returned	 to	 the	 cart	 and	 placed	 the	 red	 cap	 on	 the	 tray.	 He	 picked	 up	 the syringe.	I	narrowed	my	eyes	as	I	saw	the	second	needle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	who	this	is?	And	why	another	needle?”	I	smoothed	the	paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	my	chest	the	best	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	 glanced	 at	 the	 drawing	 as	 he	 moved	 closer	 to	 inject	 me.	 “No.”	 He	 was abrupt	and	went	back	to	work.	“And	the	second	needle	is	another	booster.”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	it	up	and	pricked	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rubbed	the	creases	in	my	brow	as	my	shoulders	slumped	a	little.	The	hope	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	disappeared	when	J	paid	little	attention	to	my	drawing.	I	stared	down	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	in	front	of	me	and	studied	its	surface.	For	the	first	time,	I	saw	tiny	flecks	of grey	dotting	the	white	table.	From	the	top	of	my	vision,	I	could	see	B2's	hands	as they	rested	in	front	of	her.	A	small	flicker	of	movement	caused	me	to	raise	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	 a	 little.	 I	 stared	 at	 B2's	 hands	 and	 once	 again	 her	 finger	 moved.	 My	 eyes scanned	up	her	arms	before	they	rested	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2's	 eyes	 focused	 on	 the	 drawing	 that	 I	 still	 had	 pressed	 to	 my	 chest.	 Her expression	was	no	longer	blank;	her	eyes	registered	recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a><b class="calibre4">Nine	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Seed</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mouth	dropped	open.	My	gaze	fixed	on	B2's	face.	The	light	had	once	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	to	her	eyes,	and	I	hoped	it	would	stay.	My	lips	moved,	and	I	spoke	J's</p>
<p class="calibre1">name,	 but	 no	 sound	 reached	 my	 ears.	 I	 forced	 more	 air	 over	 my	 vocal	 chords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“J,”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm,”	 he	 acknowledged	 as	 he	 kept	 his	 head	 bent	 over	 his	 cart	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepared	B2's	injections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She's	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">J's	head	tilted	up,	giving	me	a	full	view	of	his	masked	profile.	I	stared	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">respirator	 on	 his	 face;	 his	 amplified	 breathing	 was	 louder	 than	 usual.	 I concentrated	on	the	sound.  <i class="calibre3">Was	it	always	like	that? </i>	I	tried	to	recall	hearing	the echoed	inhale	and	exhale	of	his	breath.	I	suppressed	the	urge	to	whip	my	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 and	 look	 at	 the	 room	 from	 every	 angle.  <i class="calibre3">Am	 I	 becoming	 more	 awake? </i>	 I closed	my	eyes	for	a	moment	and	refocused	my	thoughts	on	the	immediate	issue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	 stared	 at	 the	 paper	 I	 held	 against	 my	 chest.	 She	 squinted	 for	 a	 moment then	resumed	her	steady	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 moved	 my	 hand	 over	 the	 paper	 and	 blocked	 out	 part	 of	 the	 image.	 B2's eyes	scanned	up	to	my	face.	We	glared	at	each	other	and	then	her	gaze	dropped</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	the	drawing	pressed	against	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slid	 the	 piece	 of	 paper	 down	 my	 chest	 until	 it	 curled	 and	 travelled	 across the	table	in	front	of	me.	The	whole	time	B2	followed	it	with	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	she	knows	who	this	is,”	I	said	to	J	as	he	stuck	B2	in	the	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,”	 J	 stated	 in	 monotone.	 His	 breath	 hushed	 through	 the	 respirator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	irritated	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glared	at	the	back	of	J's	head.	“Don't	you	care	that	she's	awake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course,	 but	 it	 may	 not	 be	 permanent.	 There	 is	 no	 point	 in	 getting	 our hopes	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heat	rose	up	my	neck	and	settled	in	my	cheeks.	“This	is	different,”	I	hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	straightened	at	the	sound	of	my	voice.	Despite	the	bagginess	of	his	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">suit,	 I	 could	 sense	 the	 tension	 of	 his	 muscles	 underneath.	 He	 sighed;	 his shoulders	 rounded	 as	 he	 relaxed.	 “Give	 it	 a	 little	 time,	 A2.	 If	 her	 eyes	 still register	awareness	for	the	next	twenty-four	hours,	then	we	can	move	forward.”	J</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	B2	her	second	injection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 it's	 different	 this	 time,	 I	 know	 it.	 Before	 it	 only	 lasted	 a	 couple	 of seconds,	maybe	minutes.	But	now…”	My	attention	returned	to	B2.	She	squinted</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	as	she	maintained	her	focus	on	the	drawing	that	lay	on	the	table	in	front	of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>J	cleaned	up	his	cart	and	turned	back	toward	me	as	he	pulled	it	away	from the	table.	“The	same	thing	happened	with	you	-	several	times.	I	too,	thought	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 come	 around	 only	 to	 find	 minutes	 or	 hours	 later,	 that	 you	 had	 returned	 to your	previous	state.”	He	pushed	the	cart	toward	the	door.	It	slid	open.	“Twenty-four	hours,”	he	said	again	as	he	left	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	back	at	B2	and	folded	the	drawing	with	care.	She	watched	my	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">move	 as	 I	 tucked	 it	 inside	 my	 paper	 robe.  <i class="calibre3">It	 is	 different	 this	 time, </i>	 I	 whispered inside	my	head.	I	stood	up	from	the	table	and	pushed	my	chair	back	into	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	remained	seated,	her	eyes	focused	in	front	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	better	get	up,	too,	before	they	notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	rose,	pushed	her	chair	back	into	place,	and	headed	for	our	dresser. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 underwear	 and	 green	 dress	 were	 laid	 out	 on	 my	 bed.	 I	 peeled	 my	 robe from	 my	 body	 and	 put	 on	 my	 clothing	 before	 moving	 toward	 the	 desk.	 I	 sat down,	 pulled	 my	 book	 from	 the	 shelf	 and	 placed	 it	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 I	 heard	 the gentle	whoosh	of	the	door.	The	camera	buzzed;	it	followed	B2	out	of	the	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	would	soon	be	focusing	its	attention	on	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 opened	 my	 history	 book.  <i class="calibre3">How	 many	 chapters	 had	 I	 pretended	 to	 read? </i>	 I slid	open	the	drawer	and	grabbed	my	yellow	highlighter	and	a	pencil.	I	stared	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	words	not	reading	any	of	them	as	my	thoughts	swirled	in	my	head.	My	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">gripped	the	highlighter	and	picked	out	sentences	and	words	in	pretense.	I	cared</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	for	whatever	it	was	I	studied.	I	flipped	a	page.	The	movement	of	my	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">caused	 the	 paper	 in	 the	 front	 of	 my	 dress	 to	 shift	 a	 little,	 reminding	 me	 it	 was still	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	words	bombarded	my	eyes.	I	tried	to	refocus	my	attention,	but	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	read	anything	before;	the	words	did	not	make	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 highlighted	 text	 at	 random.	 A	 single	 word	 caught	 my	 attention,	 and	 it seemed	 to	 jump	 from	 the	 page.	 To	 me,	 it	 looked	 larger	 and	 darker	 than	 any others	that	surrounded	it.	My	highlighter	ran	over	the	word,	back	and	forth.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright	yellow	accentuated	it	and	burned	it	into	my	mind.	I	closed	my	eyes.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">word	had	imprinted.	In	the	blackness	behind	my	eyelids,	the	bright	yellow	stain</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	into	a	purple	blob.	In	its	centre	was	the	word	“escape”,	and	it	glowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	all	I	could	think	of;	that	one	word	was	like	a	tiny	seed	planted	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soil,	 only	 it	 was	 an	 idea	 planted	 in	 my	 brain.	 All	 it	 needed	 was	 light	 and nourishment	to	grow	and	turn	into	a	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	buzzing	signaled	the	end	of	the	study	hour.	I	closed	my	eyes	and	shook</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	head	in	slow	motion.	When	I	opened	them	again,	they	focused	back	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">yellow	 word.	 I	 had	 been	 so	 lost	 in	 thought,	 trying	 to	 develop	 a	 plan;	 I	 hadn't turned	a	single	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cleaned	up	my	desk,	my	ears	tuned	into	the	sound	of	the	doors	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>The	impulse	to	turn	and	look	at	B2	was	almost	irresistible.	I	needed	to	know	if she	was	still	aware.  <i class="calibre3">What	if	she	isn't? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	thumped	in	my	ears	at	the	thought.	I	continued	cleaning,	and	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finished,	I	sat	on	my	bed	and	waited	for	B2	to	finish	in	the	bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 hard	 to	 sit	 still,	 hard	 to	 keep	 my	 feet	 from	 tapping	 on	 the	 floor.	 I squeezed	my	hands	together	in	my	lap.	When	the	bathroom	door	finally	opened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 jumped	 from	 my	 bed.	 The	 camera	 with	 its	 ever-watchful	 eye	 whined	 at	 my sudden	movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh	no!	Did	I	move	too	quickly? </i>	The	thought	spun	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	 plodded	 toward	 the	 table	 and	 took	 her	 seat.	 I	 continued	 toward	 the bathroom;	my	pace	slowed	by	my	worry	and	opened	the	door.	The	warm	air	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 from	 the	 blast	 of	 steam	 rushed	 into	 me.	 I	 stepped	 through	 and	 closed	 the door	behind	me.	I	leaned	back	against	it	and	closed	my	eyes.	I	took	a	deep	breath and	let	the	air	escape	from	my	pursed	lips.	With	each	slow	exhale,	the	thumping</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 heart	 slowed	 to	 a	 near	 normal	 pace.	 I	 washed	 my	 hands	 and	 exited	 the room.	I	stared	straight	ahead	as	I	moved	to	join	B2	at	the	table.	I	had	to	be	more careful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tension	 released	 from	 my	 body	 as	 I	 looked	 at	 the	 food	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 B2</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	at	her	meal,	in	the	same	manner,	she	always	had.	Her	eyes	were	trained	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	plate,	and	I	waited	with	patience	for	her	to	raise	her	head.	I	needed	to	look into	them.	I	only	hoped	when	I	did	it	wouldn't	be	my	reflection	staring	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	kept	her	focus	on	her	food.	She	seemed	fascinated	by	every	bite	she	took. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 chewed	 much	 slower	 than	 usual	 as	 though	 she	 were	 relishing	 every</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouthful.  <i class="calibre3">Look	up</i>,	I	willed.	But	she	denied	my	wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rushed	through	my	sandwich,	realizing	that	it	sat	untouched	on	my	plate	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	moved	onto	her	salad.	She	picked	up	her	fork,	gave	it	a	quick	inspection	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">plunged	it	into	the	bowl	of	greens.	I	matched	her	every	bite	as	I	kept	my	focus</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 her	 face.	 I	 wasn't	 about	 to	 look	 away	 and	 miss	 what	 I'd	 been	 waiting	 for	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoping	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2's	lips	glistened	from	the	dressing,	and	she	ran	the	tip	of	her	pink	tongue</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 them.	 She	 picked	 up	 her	 apple	 and	 turned	 it	 around	 before	 sinking	 in	 her teeth.	The	crunch	echoed	in	the	room.	I	followed	suit,	though	my	bite	was	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">smaller.	Apple	juice	ran	down	B2's	chin	as	she	chewed.	She	reached	inside	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	 with	 her	 fingers.	 The	 brown	 spec	 landed	 with	 a	 plink	 on	 her	 plate.	 B2</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	 eating.	 Her	 throat	 moved	 up	 and	 down	 as	 she	 swallowed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulverized	chunk	of	apple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seed,”	she	said,	and	she	looked	into	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a><b class="calibre4">Ten	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">From	Hope</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gasped	and	almost	dropped	my	apple.	The	sudden	inhale	sent	a	small	amount</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	juice	down	the	wrong	way,	and	I	coughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	speak,”	I	said	in	a	panicked	and	scratchy	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2's	eyes	narrowed,	and	her	lips	parted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	don't	look	at	me	like	that.	Stare	down	at	your	food	or	straight	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	you	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2's	mouth	opened,	and	I	held	my	breath.	Fear	replaced	panic	at	the	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 her	 speaking	 again.	 Her	 eyes	 drifted	 past	 my	 face	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 wall behind	me.	She	brought	the	apple	to	her	mouth	and	took	another	bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	being	watched,”	I	said	between	bites.	B2	continued	to	chew	and	stare</p>
<p class="calibre1">past	me	–	through	me.	“B2?”	My	chest	tightened.  <i class="calibre3">Is	she	gone	again? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">B2's	 eyes	 wandered	 up	 to	 my	 face	 and	 back	 down	 to	 her	 plate.	 She	 took another	bite.	“Yes,”	she	sputtered	as	she	chewed;	her	eyes	pointed	at	the	table	in front	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	loud	breath	escaped	from	my	lips.	My	body	shook	with	excitement.	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 much	 to	 tell	 her,	 but	 I	 didn't	 know	 where	 to	 start.	 “I	 hope	 you	 understand everything	I'm	saying,”	I	began.	I	took	another	bite	and	chewed	until	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	left.	Its	sweetness	flowed	down	my	throat.	With	every	meal,	food	tasted</p>
<p class="calibre1">better,	and	I	wanted	to	enjoy	every	moment.	B2	was	looking	down	at	her	piece</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	fruit.	“There's	a	camera	behind	me.	It	watches	everything	we	do.”	I	watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	and	looked	for	some	sign	of	understanding.	She	held	her	half-eaten	apple	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 right	 hand	 while	 her	 left	 lay	 flat	 on	 the	 table	 beside	 her	 tray.	 Her	 eyes focused	on	the	fruit.	I	curled	my	fingers	into	a	fist.	I	leaned	forward;	the	edge	of the	table	touched	my	upper	body.	An	idea	popped	into	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	understand	me,	slowly	raise	one	finger	on	your	left	hand.”	I	sat	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	gaze	concentrated	on	her	fingers.	The	tip	of	my	tongue	swept	over	my	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	she	raised	her	index	finger,	and	I	grinned.	“You	can	talk	when	your	back is	to	the	camera.	They	think	we're	mute.	There	is	no	microphone,	so	they	can't</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	us.	Do	you	understand?”	A	few	moments	later	B2's	finger	rose	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	continued	our	pattern	of	conversation.	We	ate;	I	explained	what	I	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	remembered,	and	B2	raised	her	finger	in	understanding.	I	did	not	mention	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sister	 thing	 and	 wouldn't	 until	 I	 was	 certain.	 As	 we	 cleaned	 up	 our	 trays	 and placed	them	in	the	dumbwaiter,	I	could	only	hope	she	truly	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	headed	toward	our	desk	and	got	ready	for	her	study	time	while	I	dressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	fitness.	The	act	had	yet	to	get	any	easier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	approached	the	door,	and	it	slid	open.	The	empty	hallway	confused	me.	J</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>was	not	waiting	on	the	other	side.	I	felt	a	little	skip	in	my	chest.	He	had	always been	there	to	escort	me	or	at	least	for	as	long	as	I	remembered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	left	out	of	my	room	and	moved	along	the	corridor.	Every	doorway</p>
<p class="calibre1">enticed	me	to	stop.	There	was	a	strong	desire	to	put	my	ear	to	the	sliding	panels and	 listen	 for	 life	 on	 the	 other	 side.	 If	 only	 the	 cameras	 weren't	 watching.	 My eyes	travelled	up	to	the	nosy	piece	of	equipment	pointed	in	my	direction,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">squinted.	It	sat	still,	its	glowing	red	eye	extinguished.	My	pulse	quickened.  <i class="calibre3">Was</i> <i class="calibre3">the	other	one	behind	me	the	same? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	overhead	flickered,	and	I	stood	still.  <i class="calibre3">What	is	happening? </i>	I	took	a deep	 breath	 and	 turned	 back	 around.	 As	 I	 moved,	 my	 ears	 listened	 for	 the familiar	 whir	 of	 the	 camera.	 An	 eerie	 stillness	 blanketed	 the	 corridor.	 The intermittent	buzzing	of	the	lights	and	my	quickened	breaths	were	the	only	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	equipment	I	stared	at	was	as	lifeless	as	the	other.	I	took	the	chance	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed	my	ear	on	the	first	door	I	saw,	but	I	heard	nothing.	I	crossed	the	hall	to the	next	door,	but	again	I	heard	only	silence.	I	moved	back	to	the	centre	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall;	 the	 lights	 overhead	 flickered.	 After	 a	 few	 seconds	 of	 hesitation,	 my	 feet moved	 me	 back	 and	 delivered	 me	 to	 the	 first	 door	 again.	 I	 waved	 my	 hand	 in front	of	the	entry	panel	and	held	my	breath.	The	seconds	ticked	by	but	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed	 and	 turned	 away.	 I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 and	 shook	 my	 head	 at	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupidity.	 The	 familiar	 sound	 of	 an	 opening	 door	 interrupted	 my	 self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">chastisement.	 I	 whirled	 around	 to	 an	 open	 doorway	 and	 stepped	 inside	 the strange	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	light	turned	on	as	I	entered	the	dark	apartment.	Inside,	it	was	as	bright</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	sterile	as	my	room.	A	bed,	free	of	sheets	and	blankets,	pressed	itself	against the	blank,	white	wall.	A	white	dresser	stood	at	its	head	and	a	desk	at	its	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	made	my	way	over	toward	the	dresser	but	came	to	a	halt	after	a	couple	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">steps.	I	clenched	my	fists	at	my	sides	and	took	a	deep	breath	as	I	gathered	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">nerve.	 My	 insides	 shook.	 I	 turned	 and	 looked	 toward	 the	 opposite	 corner.	 The surveillance	system	was	much	like	the	one	in	my	room.	But	like	the	two	cameras</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 in	 the	 hallway,	 it	 too	 sat	 motionless	 and	 dark.	 My	 pulse	 slowed,	 and	 I relaxed.	I	reached	the	dresser	and	held	my	breath.	I	opened	the	first	drawer	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 the	 next.	 Each	 was	 as	 empty	 as	 the	 room	 and	 my	 hope	 for	 finding something	 –	 anything	 -	 evaporated.	 By	 the	 time	 I	 opened	 the	 final	 drawer, disappointment	replaced	my	optimism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	trudged	over	to	the	bathroom.	Despite	the	feeling	that	I	would	find	nothing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	small	spark	of	hope	flickered.	The	empty	room	extinguished	all	that	remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	spark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heavy	feet	carried	me	out	of	the	apartment	and	back	into	the	corridor.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>turned	 my	 head	 in	 time	 to	 catch	 the	 lights	 turning	 off.	 The	 door	 closed	 behind me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	hall	was	the	second	door.  <i class="calibre3">I	might	as	well, </i>	I	thought	to	myself.	A quick	 glance	 at	 the	 cameras	 to	 either	 side	 showed	 me	 they	 remained	 still.	 The lights	overhead	flickered,	and	I	walked	across	the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	my	hand	over	the	panel.	As	with	the	first	room,	there	was	a	hesitation</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	the	doors	opened	to	another	darkened	space.	My	heart	sank	even	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	quick	inspection	of	the	area	revealed	that	it	too	was	empty	and	seemed	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	have	held	any	occupants. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Were	B2	and	I	the	only	ones	here?	Was	that	why	we	were	sharing	a	room? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 closed	 behind	 me,	 and	 I	 stepped	 into	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 corridor	 and stood	 motionless.	 For	 a	 moment,	 I	 was	 unsure	 of	 my	 next	 steps,	 but	 my	 feet moved	me	forward	before	my	mind	could	even	think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rounded	the	corner	to	my	right	and	entered	a	brighter,	buzzing	hallway.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	 of	 active	 surveillance	 systems	 indicated	 that	 the	 hall	 was	 quite	 alive.	 I inched	 toward	 the	 glass	 door	 at	 the	 far	 end.	 My	 heart	 thudded.	 I	 heard unrecognizable	voices	echo	from	the	corridor	I'd	left	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	looks	like	it's	just	this	section,	sir.”	The	voice	behind	me	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	slowed	down	my	pace	as	my	ears	strained.	After	a	long	pause,	I	heard	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	The	corridor	is	clear.”	Another	pause.	“No,	sir.	Hang	on.”	My	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	my	pace	quickened	at	the	sound	of	approaching	footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	Subject	in	sight,	sir.”	Another	pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	the	glass	door	and	placed	my	hand	on	the	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She's	about	to	enter	the	Simulation	Room,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	open	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	closed	behind	me	and	shut	out	the	rest	of	the	conversation.  <i class="calibre3">Where</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">is	J? </i>	I	questioned	myself	as	I	stepped	into	the	forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a><b class="calibre4">Eleven	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">To	Despair</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thoughts	of	J	and	his	absence	had	run	through	my	head	while	I	completed	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">circuit	training.	I	had	hoped	that	he'd	be	waiting	to	escort	me	back	to	my	room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	as	before,	I	walked	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 corridor	 outside	 my	 room	 was	 back	 to	 normal.	 The	 overhead	 lights</p>
<p class="calibre1">buzzed	and	emitted	a	steady	glow.	The	ever-watchful	red	eyes	whined	and	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	they	caught	my	every	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	 sat	 on	 her	 bed	 with	 a	 book	 in	 her	 hands.

<p class="calibre1">I	 stepped	 into	 the	 bathroom.	 My	 body	 gave	 into	 the	 freedom	 I	 had	 for	 the next	fifteen	minutes.	I	rubbed	my	forehead	in	thought	as	the	question	about	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">ages	could	not	be	ignored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	was	younger,	though	not	by	much,	a	couple	of	years	at	the	most.	I	stared</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	my	face	in	the	mirror,	leaning	closer	to	get	a	better	look.  <i class="calibre3">How	long	have	we</i> <i class="calibre3">been	here?

<p class="calibre1">A20100315L,	A	was	for	April.	I	repeated	the	numbers	again.	“Twenty,	ten,	zero, </p>
<p class="calibre1">three-fifteen,”	I	said	aloud.  <i class="calibre3">An	address? </i>	I	shook	my	head	and	stepped	inside	the glass	surroundings	of	the	shower,	warm	water	cascaded	over	the	top	of	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Twenty,	ten,	zero	three,	fifteen,”	I	chanted.	“Twenty-ten,	o-three,	fifteen.”	The numbers	rolled	through	my	mind	and	out	my	mouth.	I	tipped	my	head	back	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed	the	water	to	flow	over	my	face.	I	recited	the	numbers	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Twenty-ten.”	There	was	a	familiar	ring.	“Twenty-ten,”	I	repeated.	I	clapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	hands	with	excitement	as	it	came	to	me.  <i class="calibre3">Twenty-ten,	two-thousand	and	ten	–</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">it	 was	 the	 year	 I	 was	 born. </i>	 The	 rest	 of	 the	 numbers	 fell	 into	 place.  <i class="calibre3">Zero	 three,</i> <i class="calibre3">fifteen	 –	 March	 fifteen, </i>	 the	 numbers	 marked	 the	 month	 and	 the	 day.	 The	 water trickled,	and	I	stepped	out	of	the	shower	as	it	stopped	altogether.	Hot	air	blew	all around	me.	The	drops	of	water	evaporated.	I	ran	my	fingers	through	my	hair	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">untangled	the	drying	mess.	My	birth	date	swirled	around	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	about	the	L? </i>	I	questioned	the	final	bit	of	my	ID.  <i class="calibre3">B2	and	I	had	an	L	at</i> <i class="calibre3">the	end	of	our	identifications.

<p class="calibre1">I	 finished	 up	 in	 a	 hurry	 and	 left	 the	 privacy	 of	 the	 bathroom	 behind	 as	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>strolled	naked	from	the	room.	My	only	protection	came	from	the	fitness	clothes	I held	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	sat	in	silence	on	her	bed	engrossed	in	her	book,	or	at	least	she	pretended</p>

<p class="calibre1">I	 dressed	 quickly,	 pulling	 my	 dress	 over	 my	 head	 and	 making	 sure	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">incorporated	books	from	several	different	genres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 fingers	 bumped	 over	 the	 spines	 as	 I	 read	 the	 titles.	 I	 fixed	 on	 one particular	book	that	held	my	interest.

I	 pulled	 the	 blue novel	 with	 the	 gold	 lettering	 from	 the	 shelf	 and	 moved	 back	 to	 my	 bed.	 I	 sat down	and	leaned	back	against	the	wall.	I	drew	my	legs	toward	my	chest	and	laid</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	book	on	my	thighs.	I	opened	it	to	where	the	piece	of	paper	nestled	between</p>

I	think	I'm	going	to	freak</i> <i class="calibre3">out</i>	 –	 At	 those	 words,	 I	 looked	 up	 from	 my	 book	 and	 over	 at	 B2	 for	 a	 second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	enraptured	by	her	book.	But	I	knew	from	experience	that	her	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">reeled	with	her	questions.	She	was	likely	not	reading	anything	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	returned	to	the	paper	and	the	few	remaining	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What's	your	name?	Why	do	we	get	needles?	Are	we	going	to	get	out	of	here? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">–	 <i class="calibre3">I	hope	so</i>,	I	whispered	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slid	 the	 piece	 of	 paper	 out	 from	 the	 book	 and	 onto	 my	 stomach,	 then	 I turned	the	page.	I	folded	the	paper	with	one	hand	till	it	was	small	enough	to	fit inside	 my	 fist.	 I	 held	 onto	 it	 until	 our	 reading	 time	 came	 to	 an	 end.	 When	 I climbed	from	bed,	I	managed	to	stuff	it	down	the	front	of	my	dress.	It	rested	next to	my	drawing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>At	dinner,	I	answered	as	many	of	B2's	questions	as	I	could	between	bites	of food.	 Her	 face	 registered	 understanding	 as	 she	 stared	 off	 into	 space.	 She'd perfected	her	faked	blank	expression.	At	times	her	nose	would	wrinkle	with	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	answers.	The	action	led	me	to	believe	that	it	wasn't	satisfactory	and	likely left	her	with	more	questions.	I	did	the	best	I	could,	under	the	circumstances,	but	I couldn't	 wait	 for	 morning	 and	 J.	 I	 would	 get	 him	 to	 explain	 further.	 My	 pulse raced	a	little	at	the	thought	of	him.  <i class="calibre3">He	will	be	pleased	when	he	sees	B2	is	aware,</i> I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bedtime	 came.	 I	 tried	 to	 sleep,	 but	 every	 time	 I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 all	 I	 saw were	 B2's	 questions	 floating	 around	 behind	 my	 eyelids.	 I	 stared	 into	 the	 dark until	my	eyelids	slammed	shut	and	sleep	erased	the	dancing	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Bright	light	from	above	blinded	me.	I	rolled	over	onto	my	right	side	and	blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	wide	yawn	took	over	my	face,	and	my	eyes	watered.	I	wiped	away	the	blur	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	to	see	B2	heading	into	the	bathroom.	I	sat	up	and	stretched,	eager	to	get	the day	started	–	eager	for	J	to	arrive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	at	the	table;	B2	stared	through	me,	while	I	waited	for	the	red	light.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke	few	words,	only	telling	her	that	I	felt	we	could	trust	J	and	that	he	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	us	all	he	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 red	 light	 glowed,	 and	 my	 pulse	 quickened;	 my	 fingers	 wiggled	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">excitement.	 The	 cart	 came	 through	 the	 open	 door;	 its	 contents	 rattled	 as	 it entered	 the	 room.	 My	 eyes	 widened	 as	 they	 watched	 in	 slow	 motion.	 Blue, unfamiliar,	gloved	hands	gripped	the	handle	that	pushed	the	cart	forward.  <i class="calibre3">Did	J</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">change	glove	colours?	His	are	always	white. </i>	My	eyes	glanced	down	at	my	chest as	my	heart	thumped.	The	edge	of	the	white,	paper	robe	fluttered	with	each	beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cart	rattled	and	moved	closer	to	the	table.	Unfamiliar,	blue	eyes	stared	at	me from	behind	the	goggles	and	mask.	I	stared	past	the	stranger.	There	was	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	do	but	wait	for	the	needle	to	prick	into	my	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on,	 get	 up!	 Get	 up!”	 A	 strange	 and	 hurried	 voice	 called	 in	 my	 ear.	 My numb	body	was	pulled	forward,	and	my	eyes	fluttered	open.	A	blue-white	light</p>
<p class="calibre1">flashed	around	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wass	goin'	non?”	I	sputtered.	It	was	as	though	my	tongue	had	grown	and	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer	 fit	 inside	 my	 mouth.	 Drool	 pooled	 at	 the	 corners	 of	 my	 lips	 until	 they overflowed,	and	warm,	sticky	saliva	dripped	down	my	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	leave.”	He	pulled	on	my	arm,	my	body	followed,	and	I	sat	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 my	 feet	 resting	 on	 the	 floor.	 Tingling	 travelled	 up	 from	 my	 toes	 until	 it reached	the	top	of	my	head	and	dissipated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don	 unnastan.”	 I	 willed	 my	 tongue	 to	 function.	 “I	 don't…understand,”	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>repeated	 with	 great	 effort.	 My	 eyes	 closed,	 tired	 from	 the	 exertion	 of	 speaking those	few	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	 at	 me!”	 The	 voice	 commanded.	 A	 weight	 pressed	 down	 on	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders,	and	my	body	shook.	My	eyelids	fluttered	back	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 white-garbed	 man	 knelt	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 He	 released	 my	 shoulders	 and shone	the	blue	tinged	light	towards	himself.	I	focused	on	the	light,	and	my	brain finally	registered	that	it	came	from	a	flashlight.	My	gaze	travelled	up	the	white arm	and	rested	on	a	masked	face.	The	man's	goggles	caught	a	little	of	the	glare</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	light.	I	squinted	and	tried	to	see	behind	the	mask.	He	turned	his	head	a bit,	 and	 I	 caught	 sight	 of	 dark,	 familiar	 eyes.	 The	 light	 shook;	 my	 focus wandered	 back	 to	 his	 shaking	 hand	 then	 up	 to	 his	 covered	 face.	 His	 eyes	 were familiar,	 but	 barely.	 The	 puffy,	 multicoloured	 skin	 around	 them	 made	 them difficult	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	jaw	dropped.	“J?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wass	happen…”	I	squeezed	my	eyelids	shut	and	willed	my	tongue.	“What</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	go.”	He	rose	to	his	feet	in	what	looked	to	be	a	painful	motion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moaned	a	little	confirming	my	suspicion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wass	goin'	on?”	I	said	as	I	stood	on	shaky	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	no	time	for	that	now.”	He	grabbed	my	hand	and	pulled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	not	movin'	–	tell	me.”	My	words	came	out	a	little	rough	but	good	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	has	all	gone	awry.”	J	tugged	on	my	hand	again	as	he	turned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 has?”	 I	 glanced	 up	 at	 the	 camera	 in	 the	 room.	 My	 thoughts	 became clear.	The	red	eye	no	longer	glowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything.”	He	pulled	harder,	and	I	followed	a	few	steps	but	stopped.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn't	pulling	me	in	the	direction	of	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 are	 you	 taking	 me?”	 I	 questioned.	 My	 voice	 and	 my	 words	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">grown	stronger.	I	pulled	my	hand	free	from	J's	and	folded	my	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 cannot	 go	 out	 through	 the	 door.”	 He	 reached	 out,	 grabbed	 my	 hand, and	 pulled	 me	 toward	 the	 laundry	 chute.	 The	 door	 slid	 open	 with	 a	 loud,	 airy sound.	“Get	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gasped.	“No!”	My	heart	raced.	“The	bottom	drops	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	does	not.	It	is	more	like	an	elevator.	Now	get	in.	I	will	meet	you	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Elevator? </i>	I	couldn't	quite	grasp	what	that	was.	Panicked	thoughts	swirled	in my	 head.	 I	 tried	 to	 pull	 away,	 but	 his	 grip	 had	 tightened.	 I	 reached	 up	 to	 wipe beads	of	sweat	from	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>“B2!”	I	cried.	“You	can't	leave	her	behind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	not	worry	about	her.”	He	pulled	me	closer	to	the	opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	she's	aware.	She	talks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	grip	loosened	and	he	moved	behind	me.	“You	must	get	in.”	He	pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	forward.	I	tried	to	stiffen	my	legs,	but	they	were	still	too	weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	B2!”	I	braced	my	arms	on	the	wall	on	either	side	of	the	opening.	“B2!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	yelled.	A	sharp	point	entered	my	shoulder.	“What	you	do,”	I	slurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	we	do	not	have	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	legs	gave	out,	and	darkness	fell. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Sweet	Sounds</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 eyes	 fluttered	 open	 to	 blackness,	 and	 I	 stared	 out	 into	 the	 dark.	 I	 had	 no thoughts	or	memories.	My	mind	was	as	blank	as	a	clean	sheet	of	paper.	I	blinked</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	waited	for	something	to	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 slow	 at	 first,	 like	 the	 first	 few	 words	 typed	 in	 a	 message.	 The information	came	in	spurts	then	began	to	build,	and	the	blank	page	of	my	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled	with	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squeezed	my	eyelids	shut	and	ran	my	hand	over	the	surface	underneath	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 not	 my	 usual	 soft	 mattress	 I'd	 lain	 on	 every	 night,	 but	 something	 much different	 -	 spongy.	 My	 hands	 and	 fingertips	 investigated	 the	 material.	 They pressed	and	rubbed	as	my	mind	searched	for	recognition.	After	a	moment,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">ventured	over	the	edge	and	found	a	much	rougher	and	harder	surface.  <i class="calibre3">Am	I	lying</i> <i class="calibre3">on	a	floor? </i>	I	opened	my	eyes	back	to	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	exploration	of	the	mysterious	surface	continued	as	I	tried	to	determine</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 my	 hands	 touched.	 I	 stretched	 out	 my	 arm.	 A	 sudden	 dull	 ache	 in	 my shoulder	flooded	my	brain	with	the	memory	of	voices	and	yelling.	My	voice	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	out	to	B2,	J	responded,	a	sharp	poke,	and	then	the	darkness	that	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 memories	 returned	 and	 invaded	 not	 only	 my	 mind	 but	 my	 entire	 being. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Where	am	I? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Beads	of	sweat	formed	on	my	forehead.	Fear	enveloped	my	body.	I	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	jump	up	from	where	I	lay,	but	could	no	longer	move	–	panic	set	in	and	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	in	place.	The	beat	of	my	heart	echoed	in	my	ears.	My	mouth	opened,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 I	 was	 going	 to	 scream,	 but	 a	 quiet	 voice	 spoke	 instead.	 “B2,”	 I whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	soft	groan	came	to	my	ears;	I	whipped	my	head	to	my	right	side.	I	gasped, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	as	the	air	passed	through	my	lips,	my	heart	slowed.  <i class="calibre3">Did	I	only	imagine	the</i> <i class="calibre3">sound? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 concentrated	 hard.	 My	 ears	 strained	 to	 hear	 any	 noise,	 any	 sound	 that would	 drown	 out	 my	 beating	 heart	 and	 racing	 thoughts.	 Another	 tired	 groan echoed	 in	 the	 dark	 followed	 by	 a	 distinct	 rustling.	 I	 shivered	 and	 curled	 into	 a ball,	wrapping	my	arms	around	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who…who's	there?”	I	whispered	with	a	shaky	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	light	snore	was	my	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	unfurled	and	uncovered	my	head.	“B2?	Is	that	you?	B2,	wake	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	 rustling,	 I	 was	 certain	 I	 was	 not	 alone.	 I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and stretched	 out	 my	 arm.	 The	 dull	 ache	 returned	 to	 my	 shoulder	 once	 again.	 My stomach	 knotted	 as	 my	 fingers	 touched	 another	 sponge-like	 surface.	 I	 pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>down,	and	they	sank	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“B2!”	I	called	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 another	 groan	 and	 then	 after	 a	 moment	 of	 silence	 a	 sleep-filled word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”What?”	an	irritated	voice	whispered	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	closed	my	eyes	and	allowed	my	body	to	relax	into	the	cushioned	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 is	 you?	 It	 is	 B2,	 right?”	 For	 a	 moment	 I	 wasn't	 sure.	 B2	 had	 spoken	 few words	before.	Her	voice	was	not	familiar,	and	as	she	was	still	becoming	aware,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn't	certain	how	much	she	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-yes.	It's	m-me,”	she	stuttered	the	most	words	I'd	heard	her	speak	at	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	th-think	s-so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	onto	my	right	side	and	faced	her	voice;	my	aching	shoulder	brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	the	memory	of	the	poking	needle.	I	shifted	my	weight	a	little	until	the	ache eased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 th-thought	 we	 weren't…”	 she	 paused,	 “allowed	 to	 t-talk.”	 She	 finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	tired	and	hesitant	voice	cut	through	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 scanned	 the	 blackness	 for	 a	 red	 eye.	 After	 several	 seconds,	 I	 sighed.	 “I think	it's	okay	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 know.	 I	 don't	 think	 we're	 in	 the	 same	 place	 anymore.	 Do	 you remember	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shuffled,	and	I	waited	in	the	quiet	dark	for	her	answer.	After	a	while,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke.	 “Yes	 and	 n-no…I	 remember…,”	 she	 paused,	 “I	 r-remember…the	 p-</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture	and	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	it?”	I	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know…I	th-thought	I	knew,	but	now…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hope	turned	to	disappointment.	“What	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D-different	things…they	don't	m-make	sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 More	 thoughts	 and	 memories	 than	 before	 ran	 through	 my	 head</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	I'd	woken	up	and	nothing	made	sense	to	me	either.	“Have	you	always	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stutter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	another	long	pause	before	B2	spoke	again.	“I	don't	know…	I	th-</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	so.	Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	my	left	shoulder;	my	right	arm	rested	under	my	head	as	a	pillow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	wondered.	My	name	is	April.”	The	introduction	spilled	from	my	lips	like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>I'd	said	it	many	times	before.	Of	course,	I	was	sure	I	had,	for	the	moment	I	didn't remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm…”	she	paused.	“Hmph,	I	d-don't	know.”	She	sounded	a	little	frustrated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn't	remember	my	name	at	first	either,	at	least	not	until	I	dreamt	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	 I	 should	 g-go	 back	 to	 sleep.”	 She	 spoke	 without	 pauses,	 the	 first since	waking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	might	help.	Anyway,	I	already	know	it	starts	with	the	letter	B.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	d-do?”	Her	voice	perked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	figured	it	out	before…”	I	was	about	to	say	'before	we	left	C.E.C.I.L.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	wasn't	quite	sure	we	weren't	still	there.	“At	C.E.C.I.L.	Your	ID	begins	with the	first	initial	of	your	first	name	and	ends	with	the	first	initial	of	your	last	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	numbers	in-between	are	your	birthday.”	I	smiled	at	my	reasoning.	But	doubt</p>
<p class="calibre1">erased	it	within	seconds	of	telling	my	idea	to	someone	else.	“At	least,	I	think	it is.	Anyway,”	I	pushed	the	doubt	away	and	replaced	it	with	self-confidence.	“We</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	 have	 the	 same	 last	 initial,	 L,	 and	 J	 said	 we	 were	 sisters.	 Did	 you	 know that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 there	 was	 silence	 before	 B2	 spoke,	 “I	 remember	 him	 s-saying that.”	She	sounded	as	though	she	were	smiling.	“Are	you	sure	he's	t-telling	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	smile	disappeared;	the	memory	of	him	dragging	me	toward	the	laundry</p>
<p class="calibre1">chute	came	back.	“I	don't	know,”	I	snapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	wrong?”	B2's	voice	echoed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed.	 “I	 think	 he	 brought	 us	 here,	 but	 I	 don't	 know	 why.”	 I	 rolled	 over onto	my	back	and	stared	up	into	the	blackness.	“I	feel	more	trapped	than	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	C.E.C.I.L?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	both	a	what	and	a	who.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rolled	 back	 over	 to	 my	 side,	 ignored	 the	 protest	 of	 my	 shoulder,	 and propped	my	head	up	in	my	hand.	“C.E.C.I.L	-	Contagion	Eradication	Centre	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intelligent	 Life.	 Cecil	 –	 the	 guy	 who	 invented	 it,	 or	 came	 up	 with	 it,	 or whatever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	little…v-vain…isn't	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha,”	I	laughed,	“Yes,	and	I	would	say	a	lot	vain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-what's	it	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	but	it	can't	be	good.	Contagion	means	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disease.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	my	eyebrows.	I	still	had	trouble	remembering	the	odd	word,	but	B2</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>didn't	seem	to	have	a	problem.	“Yes.	And	eradication–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	rid	of,	d-destroy,”	B2	interrupted	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	you	ask	if	you	already	had	it	figured	out?”	I	pressed	the	fingertips</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	free	hand	into	my	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	just	came	to	m-me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	must	be	smart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	t-too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know.	Maybe	a	little.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	a	lot.	You	figured	out	the	ID	th-thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	wasn't	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	 just	 s-say	 we're	 both	 smart.”	 There	 was	 an	 awkward	 silence	 for	 a moment,	 and	 then	 B2	 continued.	 “Centre	 for	 Intelligent	 Life,”	 she	 said.	 “We wouldn't	b-be	there	if	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	weren't	intelligent.”	It	was	my	turn	to	interrupt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 lay	 in	 the	 dark,	 an	 easy	 silence	 between	 us.	 My	 mind	 worked	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">revisiting	memories,	old	and	new,	and	placed	them	into	chronological	order.	B2's</p>
<p class="calibre1">soft	 snoring	 caused	 a	 smile	 to	 spread	 across	 my	 face.	 My	 eyelids	 grew	 heavy, and	despite	my	attempts	to	stay	awake,	I	drifted	back	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moments	or	hours	later	there	was	no	telling	which,	my	eyes	sprung	open	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	darkened	room.	I	stretched	my	arms	above	my	head,	but	a	sharp	pinch	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder	 caused	 me	 to	 pull	 them	 back	 down	 to	 my	 side.	 My	 hands	 absently plucked	 at	 the	 cushioned	 surface	 underneath	 me.	 I	 rolled	 the	 small	 bits	 of	 soft material	between	my	fingers	and	dropped	them	on	the	floor.	B2's	quiet	and	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">breaths	 lulled	 me	 into	 a	 state	 of	 relaxation.	 My	 arms	 and	 legs	 grew	 heavy	 and sunk	 further	 into	 the	 cushion	 beneath	 me.	 I	 was	 about	 to	 cross	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconsciousness,	but	a	low	groan	pulled	me	back.	The	sound	of	a	rustling	sheet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	smacking	lips	disturbed	the	quiet	dark	surrounding	me.	“B2!”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 awake?”	 I	 turned	 my	 head	 to	 the	 right	 and	 stared	 out	 to	 where	 I imagined	her	lying	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	groaned	again,	a	little	louder	than	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	a	yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm!”	she	mumbled.	“I	w-was	having	a	g-good	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!”	I	placed	my	finger	on	my	lips,	even	though	I	knew	B2	couldn't	see	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">gesture.	I	turned	my	head	away	and	stared	up	at	the	dark	above	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	hear	that?”	My	thoughts	were	fuzzy	and	unsure.	I	concentrated	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	silence.  <i class="calibre3">Am	I	hearing	things? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	d-don't	hear	anything.	Let	me	g-go	back	to	sleep.”	B2	stammered	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	cranky	voice.	I	imagined	her	crossing	her	arms	and	stomping	her	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>The	 corners	 of	 my	 lips	 pulled	 into	 a	 smile,	 but	 it	 was	 fleeting	 as	 my	 focus returned	to	the	sound	I	was	sure	I'd	heard.	The	crease	in	my	brow	deepened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rolled	 my	 eyes.	 “Listen!”	 My	 words	 were	 sharp.	 I	 closed	 my	 eyelids	 and inhaled,	 held	 it,	 and	 then	 allowed	 it	 to	 rush	 out	 through	 my	 pursed	 lips.	 “It sounded…”	I	searched	my	memory	and	tried	to	recall	the	sound	I	was	sure	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears	picked	out	in	the	dark,	“like	rain.”	The	blackness	closed	in	around	us,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 waited	 in	 silence	 for	 a	 sound	 we	 hadn't	 heard	 in…	  <i class="calibre3">How	 long	 had	 it	 been? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Months	–	years? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!”	I	silenced	B2	once	again.	She	shuffled	beside	me.	Even	in	the	dark,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood	she'd	rolled	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 there	 was	 a	 delicate	 tapping	 overhead.	 At	 first,	 it	 was	 a	 few	 light beats,	 a	 random	 collection	 of	 taps.	 Within	 seconds,	 it	 settled	 into	 a	 rhythmic pattern.	I	was	sure	it	was	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knew	it.	It	 <i class="calibre3">is</i>	rain.”	I	smiled	and	sat	up,	my	hands	behind	me	for	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 delight	 did	 not	 last	 long.  <i class="calibre3">Where	 the	 hell	 are	 we? </i>	 My	 eyebrows	 pulled together,	and	my	smile	turned	into	a	frown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rain?”	 B2's	 voice	 whispered.	 She	 shuffled	 once	 again;	 her	 hand	 brushed the	back	of	mine	as	she	sat	up	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 searched	 my	 memory	 for	 the	 last	 time	 I'd	 seen	 rain.	 Visions	 from	 my strange	 dream	 of	 the	 dried	 grass	 came	 to	 mind.	 There	 was	 a	 bizarre	 feeling, almost	an	understanding,	that	it	had	been	a	long	time.	If	I	knew	how	long	we'd</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 at	 C.E.C.I.L.,	 then	 I'd	 have	 a	 bit	 of	 an	 idea,	 but	 my	 memories	 were	 still foggy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	moment	there	was	nothing	else	I	wanted	more	than	to	see	the	rain,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	 it	 wash	 over	 my	 head	 and	 down	 my	 face	 as	 it	 fell	 from	 the	 sky.	 My	 mind tried	 again	 to	 sort	 through	 the	 stored	 memories	 I	 managed	 to	 conjure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	they	were	not	clear,	and	I	could	not	gather	any	accurate	details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dream	interrupted	my	thoughts	and	brought	with	it	visions	of	cool,	soft, </p>
<p class="calibre1">green	 grass.	 I	 reveled	 in	 the	 memory.	 Real	 grass	 under	 my	 bare	 feet,	 my	 toes curled	 at	 the	 thought.	 Almost	 in	 the	 same	 instant,	 the	 grass	 turned	 to	 brown, sharp	blades.	C.E.C.I.L's	Astroturf	flashed	in	my	mind.	Grass	–	that	was	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	I	longed	for,	even	the	brown,	crunchy	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	m-mean	–	r-rain?”	B2	whispered	with	an	impatient	tone.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	snapped	me	back	to	our	reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	you	remember	rain?”	With	the	help	of	some	faint	light	source,	shapes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 shadows	 began	 to	 form	 as	 my	 eyes	 adjusted	 to	 the	 dark.	 The	 light highlighted	B2's	shadowy	figure	sitting	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	w-what	rain	is.”	Once	again	B2	did	nothing	to	keep	her	impatience</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>from	showing.	There	was	a	long	pause	as	we	sat	listening	to	the	drumming	beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	j-just	can't	remember	when	I	s-saw	it	last.”	Her	tone	softened	to	one	that	was more	wistful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	in	silence,	each	of	us	lost	in	our	thoughts	and	memories.	“I've	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	remember,	but…”	I	sighed,	“I	can't,”	I	admitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Tap,	tap,	tap. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	I	could	remember,”	B2	whispered	so	low	I	had	to	strain	my	ears	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	what	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Tap,	tap,	tap</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 will.	 We	 will	 both	 remember	 –	 everything.”	 I	 wanted	 to	 believe	 my words,	but	as	they	fell	from	my	lips,	I	wondered	if	that	would	ever	be	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 sat	 still	 and	 listened	 to	 the	 soothing	 sound	 of	 the	 rain	 pounding	 on	 the roof	overhead.	My	heavy	lids	closed	for	a	moment,	and	I	yawned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	s-sound	is	making	me	sleepy.”	B2	yawned	in	return.	Her	voice	caused</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	eyes	to	spring	open,	and	my	heart	raced	as	though	she'd	wakened	me	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“I	have	no	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	th-think	we're	still	at	C.E.C.I.L.	but	m-maybe	somewhere	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 concentrated	 and	 forced	 myself	 to	 remember.  <i class="calibre3">We	 have	 to	 leave</i>,	 J's	 voice whispered.	I	shook	my	head.	“No.	I	thought	so	at	first.	But	no,	we're	somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	d-do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	J	said	we	were	leaving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	maybe	we	didn't.	Maybe	he	only	told	you	that.	M-maybe	–	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	 I	 cut	 B2	 off	 mid-sentence.	 “J	 said	 we	 were	 leaving.”	 My	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">clenched	in	my	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!	You	don't	know	J	like	I	do.	I	trust	him…	I…”	My	voice	wavered	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered	him	pushing	me	toward	the	laundry	chute.	My	eyes	squeezed	shut</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	memory	of	my	voice	calling	for	B2.  <i class="calibre3">He	did	bring	her	–	he	hadn't	left	B2</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">behind. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	where	is	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 know,”	 I	 whispered.	 My	 attitude	 dissolved	 with	 her	 words.	 “He'll show	up	soon.”	I	bit	my	lip.	I	hoped	I	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	darkened	room	was	different.	It	wasn't	sterile	like	our	room.	I	filled	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">lungs.	 The	 warm,	 stale	 air	 filtered	 through	 my	 nostrils.	 Traces	 of	 familiar	 and unfamiliar	smells	stayed	behind.	Like	something	my	nose	knew,	but	my	memory</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>couldn't	quite	wrap	around.	My	eyelids	fluttered.	“I'm	tired.”	I	lay	back	down	as my	mind	continued	to	search	its	memories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“M-me	too.”	B2's	hand	rested	on	my	leg	for	a	moment.	“If	you	trust	J,	then	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">d-do,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sucked	my	lips	into	my	mouth.	I	hoped	I	hadn't	misread	J	and	that	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">trustworthy.	I	held	my	hand	out	in	front	of	me	and	turned	it	back	and	forth.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 had	 grown	 lighter,	 but	 it	 wasn't	 enough	 to	 show	 our	 new	 surroundings.	 I could	at	least	see	my	hand	moving	in	front	of	my	face.	It	wouldn't	be	long	before we	saw	where	we	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	not	s-so	dark,	anymore,”	B2	spoke	as	though	she'd	read	my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head,	“No.”	My	hand	flopped	back	down	by	my	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Tap,	tap,	tap. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rhythmic	drumming	 of	the	rain	 was	hypnotizing,	and	 my	eyelids	 grew</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavy.	 B2's	 breathing	 eased	 into	 a	 quiet	 snore	 beside	 me.	 I	 forced	 my	 eyelids open	and	stared	up	at	the	darkened	rafters,	the	first	glimpse	of	any	detail	in	the room.  <i class="calibre3">Where	are	we? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soothing	 tapping	 on	 the	 roof	 pulled	 my	 attention	 away	 from	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts,	and	my	eyes	fell	shut.	My	leg	jumped,	as	though	it	was	trying	to	keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	awake,	but	it	was	too	late	as	sleep	had	begun	to	take	its	hold	once	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirteen	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">J	Returns</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	blinked	open,	sleep	blurred	my	vision.	I	rubbed	them	awake,	getting	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	real	look	of	our	room	in	the	dim	light.	I	stared	up	at	the	small,	high	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	initial	moments	of	actual	daylight	–	the	first	that	I	had	seen	in	a	long	while	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">captivated	me.	My	mind	shifted	back	to	the	simulation	room.	The	painted	blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky,	the	fake	clouds,	and	the	solar	lights	could	not	compete	with	the	real	thing.	I thought	of	the	large	fans	that	imitated	the	wind	and	pushed	around	the	artificial trees	and	grass.	I	heard	the	recorded	sounds	of	birds	and	insects	that	played	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 unending	 loop	 in	 my	 head.  <i class="calibre3">What	 happened	 to	 everything	 or	 is	 it	 all	 still</i> <i class="calibre3">there?	What	happened	when	J	said	everything	had	gone	awry? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 squeezed	 my	 eyes	 shut	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 pushed	 away	 my	 thoughts	 and memories.	 When	 I	 opened	 them	 again,	 my	 gaze	 fixed	 on	 the	 faint	 light,	 and	 it made	my	heart	beat	a	little	faster.  <i class="calibre3">This	is	real. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 soft	 snore	 pulled	 my	 attention	 away	 from	 the	 window	 and	 down	 to	 the sleeping	form	on	the	floor	in	front	of	me.	B2	curled	on	her	left	side	and	faced	my direction.	Her	skin	glowed	in	the	faint	light,	her	arms	folded	close	to	her	body, and	her	hands	tucked	under	her	head	for	support.	Her	pink	lips	puckered,	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">emitted	 a	 small	 endearing	 snort.	 She	 was	 peaceful.	 She	 was	 my	 sister.	 I	 knew that	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memories	 from	 my	 past	 floated	 in	 front	 of	 my	 eyes.	 And	 they	 were	 not random	 fragments	 from	 a	 strange	 dream	 but	 were	 real	 memories.	 There	 were memories	of	times	we	played	together	and	moments	we	fought.	We	were	typical</p>
<p class="calibre1">siblings	–	best	of	friends	one	minute,	rivals	the	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	concentrated	on	another	memory	as	it	worked	its	way	to	the	surface.	A	pink</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	black	birthday	cake	with	a	number	ten	candle	that	burned	in	the	centre.  <i class="calibre3">Was</i> <i class="calibre3">it	 my	 birthday? </i>	 I	 shook	 my	 head	 in	 answer	 to	 my	 questioning	 thoughts.	 No,	 it was	hers.	It	was	B2's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	memory	of	my	sister's	tenth	birthday	was	vivid	in	my	mind.	Turning	ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	as	big	of	a	deal	to	her	as	my	thirteenth	birthday	had	been	to	me	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">months	 before.	 She	 had	 left	 the	 single	 digit	 years	 behind,	 while	 I	 had	 finally become	a	teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 thoughts	 drifted	 to	 our	 ID	 numbers;	 my	 assumptions	 had	 been	 correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 birth	 dates	 were	 three	 years	 and	 a	 few	 months	 apart.	 A	 reminiscent	 smile spread	across	my	face.	I	returned	to	the	memory,	afraid	that	it	would	disappear	if I	didn't	etch	it	into	my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	black	number-ten	candle	sat	in	the	centre	of	the	birthday	cake.	Beads	of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">melted	wax	ran	down	and	dripped	onto	the	pink	frosting.	Black	icing	was	piped</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a> <i class="calibre3">along	 the	 top	 edge	 and	 around	 the	 bottom.	 Tiny	 white	 frosting	 flowers	 with</i> <i class="calibre3">yellow	centres	adorned	the	cake	in	a	random	pattern. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Pink	 and	 black	 were	 B2's	 favourite	 colours	 and	 our	 mother</i>…I	 stopped remembering.  <i class="calibre3">Where	was	our	mother	in	all	this	-	where	was	our	father? </i>	It	was the	 first	 time	 since	 becoming	 aware	 that	 thoughts	 of	 them	 came	 to	 my	 mind.	 I narrowed	my	gaze	as	I	tried	to	conjure	their	images.	Hazy	faces	appeared	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	definition.	They	could	have	been	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadness	enveloped	me,	and	I	swallowed	back	the	tightness	in	my	throat.	B2</p>
<p class="calibre1">mumbled	 unintelligible	 words;	 a	 small	 smile	 came	 to	 her	 lips.  <i class="calibre3">Maybe	 she	 is</i> <i class="calibre3">dreaming	 of	 our	 parents	 right	 now,	 maybe	 she	 will	 remember. </i>	 I	 ran	 my	 fingers through	my	tangled	hair	and	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shut	 my	 eyes	 and	 returned	 to	 the	 memory.  <i class="calibre3">Mother	 had	 always	 made	 our</i> <i class="calibre3">birthday	cakes,	regardless	of	how	busy	she	was	with	her	work.	It	was	a	tradition</i> <i class="calibre3">in	 our	 house,	 and	 no	 matter	 what	 we	 wanted,	 she	 always	 came	 through.	 While</i> <i class="calibre3">she	made	birthday	cakes	and	planned	parties,	father	shopped	for	the	present. </i>	I squeezed	 my	 eyelids	 tighter	 as	 I	 concentrated	 on	 B2's	 tenth	 birthday.	 I remembered	sitting	in	my	father's	office	as	he	surfed	the	internet	looking	for	the perfect	 gift.  <i class="calibre3">B2	 had	 wanted	 the	 latest	 in	 the	 world	 of	 telekinetic	 toys.	 While</i> <i class="calibre3">searching,	he	began	to	laugh.	His	sudden	outburst	had	confused	me;	I	stared	at</i> <i class="calibre3">him	 and	 waited	 for	 and	 explanation.	 After	 a	 moment,	 he	 revealed	 his	 laughter</i> <i class="calibre3">was	 due	 to	 the	 unexpected	 return	 of	 a	 childhood	 memory.	 As	 a	 young	 boy,	 his</i> <i class="calibre3">vivid	 and	 active	 imagination	 had	 led	 him	 to	 believe	 something	 had	 occurred</i> <i class="calibre3">when	 it	 had	 not.	 The	 supposed	 act	 had	 reduced	 him	 to	 a	 ball	 of	 tears	 and	 had</i> <i class="calibre3">frightened	 my	 grandfather.	 It	 was	 only	 when	 my	 father	 had	 calmed	 down	 and</i> <i class="calibre3">wiped	 his	 tears	 that	 he'd	 revealed	 he'd	 only	 imagined	 the	 situation.	 The</i> <i class="calibre3">daydream	had	been	so	intense	that	it	had	scared	him. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	giggled.	He	and	I	shared	the	same	creative	nature	and	wild	imagination.	At</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	time,	I	didn't	think	the	story	was	funny,	and	now	for	some	strange	reason,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	the	humour	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 focus	 returned	 to	 B2.	 She	 slept	 in	 blissful	 peace,	 undisturbed	 by	 my laughter.  <i class="calibre3">Am	I	all	she	has	now? </i>	I	reached	over	and	brushed	away	a	lock	of	hair that	 had	 fallen	 across	 her	 face.	 The	 vision	 of	 the	 picture	 I'd	 drawn	 back	 at C.E.C.I.L	came	to	mind.	My	hand	pressed	against	my	chest.	I	could	almost	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	paper	poking	into	my	skin	and	hear	its	crinkling	sound,	but	it	was	only	in	my mind.	I	had	placed	the	illustration	under	the	mattress	while	making	my	bed.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing	was	now	long	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 I	 thought	 back	 to	 the	 birthday	 cake.	 When	 I	 had	 it	 in	 view,	 I lifted	 my	 head	 and	 looked	 around	 the	 room	 at	 the	 blurred	 faces	 of	 family	 and guests.	 The	 only	 one	 that	 was	 clear	 was	 B2's.	 I	 squeezed	 my	 eyelids	 tighter</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>trying	to	focus	on	the	vision,	but	there	was	nothing	more.	No	images	or	echoes of	voices	came	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	over	onto	my	back;	my	eyes	focused	on	the	high	ceiling	above.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">smell	in	the	air	around	me	stirred	up	a	faint	memory.	The	image	of	Grandpa's	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">barn	flashed	in	my	mind,	as	the	memory	of	musty,	wet	wood	filled	my	nose.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">wistful	smile	tugged	at	my	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	up,	careful	not	to	disturb	B2,	and	stretched	my	hands	out	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	The	dim	light	was	not	quite	enough	to	illuminate	the	whole	room.	I	took	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	tentative	steps	not	wanting	to	awaken	my	sleeping	sister	or	alert	someone	of my	movement.	I	wasn't	sure	J	had	brought	us	here	and	if	he	did,	if	he	could	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">trusted.	 But,	 remaining	 quiet	 was	 difficult.	 With	 each	 step,	 the	 rough,	 wooden boards	under	my	bare	feet	creaked.	Each	creak	sounded	louder	than	the	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six,”	 I	 whispered	 under	 my	 breath	 as	 my	 hands	 made	 contact	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">uneven,	wooden	surface	of	the	nearest	wall.	It	had	taken	me	six	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 rustling	 behind	 me	 caused	 me	 to	 whirl	 around.	 B2	 had	 rolled	 onto	 her back	with	her	head	tilted	to	one	side.	A	small	breath	of	relief	escaped	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	toward	the	wall	again	and	with	caution,	ran	my	hands	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rough,	dark	surface.	My	fingertips	caught	on	the	occasional	protrusion.	I	rubbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	them	trying	to	understand	what	they	were,	but	in	the	dim	light,	I	could	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	frustration	grew	as	I	moved	along.	There	were	no	sliding	doors	to	open, </p>
<p class="calibre1">no	door	knobs	to	turn,	or	light	switches	to	flick.	Apart	from	the	window,	nothing else	indicated	we	were	in	an	ordinary	room.	The	faint	light	made	it	difficult	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 a	 clear	 view	 of	 the	 area	 I	 tiptoed	 around.	 My	 mind	 drew	 a	 picture	 as	 my fingers	traced	the	walls,	and	I	counted	the	steps	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 reached	 the	 final	 corner,	 I	 had	 a	 clear	 picture	 of	 the	 area.	 It	 was longer	than	it	was	wide	and	there	didn't	seem	to	be	anything	that	suggested	there was	 an	 entry	 into	 the	 room.	 A	 small,	 circular	 window	 was	 placed	 high	 in	 the centre	of	an	end	wall.	It	was	the	only	window	in	the	room,	and	my	heart	beat	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	faster	whenever	I	looked	up	at	it.	It	was	the	first	window	we'd	had	access	to in…	I	didn't	know	how	long	and	if	I	ever	saw	J	again,	I	was	going	to	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	flood	of	thoughts,	ideas,	and	possibilities	entered	my	mind	as	I	stared	up	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 window.	 Unfortunately,	 I	 couldn't	 stand	 underneath	 it	 to	 get	 a	 good	 look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 large	 object	 that	 prevented	 me	 from	 getting	 too	 close.	 And	 in	 the dim	light,	it	seemed	it	was	the	only	thing	in	the	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tiptoed	back	toward	the	centre	of	the	room,	towards	my	sister.	Each	gentle</p>
<p class="calibre1">step	 emitted	 a	 low	 whine	 from	 the	 floorboards.	 I	 crouched	 down	 until	 I	 sat	 on my	thin	mattress.	My	flesh	prickled	into	goosebumps	as	a	shiver	rose	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>feet	and	carried	its	way	up	to	the	top	of	my	head.	My	body	trembled	as	my	mind buzzed	 with	 thoughts.  <i class="calibre3">What	 if	 J	 doesn't	 come	 back?	 What	 if	 someone	 else</i> <i class="calibre3">brought	us	here?	What	if	the	vaccinations	we	received	don't	work	and	what	were</i> <i class="calibre3">they	 for	 anyway? </i>	 I	 looked	 back	 up	 at	 the	 dirty	 window;	 the	 light	 outside	 was becoming	brighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	you	d-doing?”	B2's	sleepy	voice	cut	through	the	eerie	silence.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">startled	me,	and	my	heart	skipped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	 go	 back	 to	 sleep,”	 I	 whispered.	 My	 eyes	 still	 focused	 on	 the window.	The	desire	to	look	outside	and	see	where	we	were	was	growing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can't.	I'm	not	tired	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	anyway.”	I	pulled	the	thin	blanket	lying	at	her	waist	all	the	way	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 getting	 hungry.”	 B2	 pushed	 the	 blanket	 back	 down,	 sat	 up,	 and	 faced me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 enough	 light	 in	 the	 room	 to	 pick	 out	 her	 features,	 from	 her	 tiny ball	of	a	nose	to	her	slightly	pointed	chin.	'  <i class="calibre3">You	can	certainly	tell	they're	sisters</i>.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	strange	voice	from	the	past	spoke	in	my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 thought	 back	 to	 my	 reflection	 and	 agreed	 with	 the	 voice.	 We	 were	 alike with	the	slightest	of	differences.	B2	had	wavy,	brown	hair	and	icy	blue	eyes.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	was	straight,	and	my	blue	eyes	were	not	quite	as	piercing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 hungry,	 too.”	 I	 nodded,	 my	 stomach	 rumbled	 in	 confirmation.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	caught	me	off	guard,	and	my	hand	hurried	to	press	against	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	J	brings	us	some	f-food	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded	 again.	 My	 stomach	 tightened,	 but	 not	 from	 hunger.	 There	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 about	 our	 new	 living	 quarters	 that	 made	 my	 muscles	 tense.	 Until	 J</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared,	I	didn't	think	that	feeling	was	going	to	go	away	any	time	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 th-think	 it's	 way	 past	 b-breakfast.”	 B2	 rubbed	 a	 hand	 over	 her	 growling stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	scheduled	meals	were	always	on	time.	“It	is.”	I	confirmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flashes	of	the	last	meal	we	ate	at	C.E.C.I.L	came	to	mind,	or	at	least	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">meal	I	recalled.	It	had	been	breakfast.	A	laugh	came	to	my	lips	as	I	remembered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	had	hit	the	handle	of	her	spoon	by	accident	when	she	reached	for	a	mouthful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cereal.	The	round	oats	catapulted	forward,	and	while	most	landed	on	the	table, one	had	managed	to	land	on	the	top	of	her	head.	A	drop	of	milk	trailed	down	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2's	 lips	 had	 trembled	 as	 she	 held	 in	 her	 laugh.	 I,	 however,	 wore	 a	 broad grin	at	the	mess.	Had	it	not	been	for	the	camera	watching	us,	I	would	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolling	 with	 laughter.	 After	 that	 meal,	 we'd	 each	 received	 a	 full	 dose	 of	 the hypno-drug,	and	I	had	no	memory	of	any	other	meals	after	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“What	did	we	have	for	s-supper	–	I	don't	remember.”	B2	stared	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“I	only	remember	breakfast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh,	me	too!	Why?”	Her	nose	crinkled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Needles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	 stared	 at	 me	 with	 a	 glazed	 over	 expression	 like	 she	 had	 many	 times before.	The	light	returned	to	her	eyes.	“Ohhh!	J	better	come	s-soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 bit	 my	 lower	 lip;	 my	 pulse	 picked	 up	 speed.	 I	 couldn't	 help	 the	 growing concern	 that	 J	 was	 not	 going	 to	 come	 back.	 I	 pressed	 my	 fingertips	 to	 my forehead,	 and	 I	 smiled	 weakly	 at	 B2.	 There	 was	 no	 need	 for	 her	 to	 know	 my worry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 room	 brightened.	 The	 details	 I	 had	 looked	 for	 earlier	 appeared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">emerging	from	the	dark	shadows.	I	tilted	my	head	back	and	looked	at	the	rafters</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	ceiling.	The	rough	wooden	beams	matched	the	rest	of	the	wood.	We	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">definitely	no	longer	at	C.E.C.I.L. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Av!”	B2	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 immediacy	 in	 her	 words	 caught	 my	 attention,	 and	 I	 abandoned	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">careful	investigation	of	our	confines.	“Why	did	you	call	me,	Av?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	shrugged.	“I,	I	don't	know,	it	s-seemed	normal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shut	 my	 eyes,	 the	 word	 Av	 floated	 in	 front	 of	 them.	 A	 tiny	 voice,	 B2's voice,	whispered	the	word	in	my	head.	It	was	a	name	she	used	when	she	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 attention.	 Av	 was	 short	 for	 Avril,	 the	 French	 word	 for	 April,	 it	 was	 the nickname	my	parents	called	me.	My	shoulders	rounded	as	the	vague	memory	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 mother's	 face	 came	 to	 mind.	 It	 was	 still	 unrecognizable,	 but	 it	 was	 hers.	 I opened	my	eyes	and	nodded.	“It's	normal.	You	called	me	that	sometimes,	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	mom	and	dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2's	 eyes	 widened	 as	 my	 ears	 picked	 out	 the	 rattling	 sound	 behind	 me.	 I scooted	around.	B2	shuffled;	the	weight	of	her	pressed	into	my	back	as	she	sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	behind.	My	heart	quickened,	and	I	grabbed	my	sheet	and	covered	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	into	the	room	in	a	slow	and	even	motion.	A	man	dressed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	jeans	and	a	grey	plaid	shirt	stepped	inside.	Dark	glasses	hid	his	eyes,	and	a white	 surgical	 mask	 covered	 his	 face.	 Blue,	 rubber	 gloves	 protected	 his	 hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pulled	a	cart	behind	him.	The	clanking	of	items	reminded	me	of	J. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	sleep	well?	I	brought	you	breakfast.”	He	removed	the	white	towel</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 covered	 the	 top	 of	 the	 tray	 and	 revealed	 two	 bowls,	 spoons,	 and	 a	 box	 of cereal.	Two	small	containers	of	milk	also	sat	on	the	tray.	“It	is	not	much,	but	it will	keep	you	from	starving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“J?”	I	said,	standing	up	from	my	mat.	I	took	a	step	forward,	but	he	held	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!	Do	not	come	any	closer.”	He	leaned	forward	and	pulled	out	two	large</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>buckets	from	underneath	the	cart	and	a	roll	of	toilet	paper.	“I	am	sorry,	but	you will	 have	 to	 use	 these	 for	 now	 as	 your	 toilet.	 Perhaps	 later…Well,	 again	 I	 am sorry.”	He	set	the	two	buckets	down	and	placed	the	roll	of	toilet	paper	inside	one of	them	before	returning	the	lid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	happened?	Where	are	we?”	I	said.	I	folded	my	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	sighed.	“Know	that	you	are	safe,	you	are	no	longer	at	C.E.C.I.L.	it	is	all	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	tell	you	right	now.	I	am	trying	to	work	on	a	plan.”	J	turned	and	headed	to	the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	plan?”	I	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	bring	you	some	clothes	later.	Oh!”	J	turned	back	and	faced	me.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	want	these	for	a	bit.”	He	reached	into	his	shirt	pocket,	pulled	out	two	pairs of	sunglasses,	and	placed	them	on	the	floor.	“It	should	not	take	too	long	for	your eyes	to	adjust	to	real	sunlight.”	He	looked	up	toward	the	window	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“J?”	I	called	again	as	he	turned	and	headed	toward	the	door.	“What's	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stopped	 for	 a	 moment	 but	 didn't	 turn	 around.	 “I	 do	 not	 know,”	 he	 said and	walked	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 ran	 forward	 and	 grabbed	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 door	 as	 J	 tried	 to	 pull	 it	 closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“J?”	I	cried.	My	fingers	lost	their	hold,	and	it	slammed	shut.	Dust	and	dirt	rained down	on	us	from	the	rafters	of	the	high	ceiling	above.	My	fists	pounded	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance.	“J!”	I	yelled.	I	put	my	ear	to	the	door,	but	all	I	heard	was	the	clunking of	something	heavy	banging	against	it	on	the	other	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a><b class="calibre4">Fourteen	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Wooden	Sentry</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grabbed	 the	 box	 of	 cereal	 from	 the	 cart,	 turned	 it	 over	 in	 my	 hands,	 and examined	the	carton.	I	chuckled	under	my	breath	as	B2's	cereal	mishap	came	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	once	again.	I	glanced	up	at	B2.	She	glared	at	me	as	though	she	knew	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts.	My	stomach	rumbled,	and	I	returned	to	my	inspection.	It	wasn't	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	hoping	or	expecting,	but	under	the	circumstances,	it	was	better	than	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 only	 hoped	 that	 our	 usual	 morning	 fare	 would	 return	 once	 things	 settled, though	a	part	of	me	doubted	it.	I	shook	the	box	then	pulled	open	the	flap,	noting that	it	wasn't	new	and	in	fact,	had	already	been	opened.	I	guessed	about	a	bowl's worth	of	cereal	was	missing	from	the	unsealed	bag.	I	poured	a	small	amount	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	bowl.	Each	piece	clinked	in	a	random	melody	as	they	hit	the	inside	of	the	china dish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stirred	the	cereal	with	my	finger	and	inspected	the	dried	bits.	I	scrutinized</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	carton	of	milk	before	I	poured	it	into	the	dish.	Satisfied	that	it	was	edible,	I moved	back	toward	my	mat	and	sat	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 k-kind	 is	 it?”	 B2	 said.	 Her	 nose	 wrinkled	 as	 she	 craned	 her	 neck	 a little	to	get	a	look	at	my	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	puffed	stuff.”	I	stared	at	the	small	pieces	floating	in	the	milk	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoon	before	placing	it	in	my	mouth.	The	cereal	was	sweet,	but	something	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory	 told	 me	 it	 wasn't	 as	 fresh	 as	 it	 should	 have	 been.	 I	 chewed	 with consideration;	the	soft	crunching	was	loud	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	any	g-good?”	B2	said.	Her	eyes	fixed	on	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shrugged	 and	 swallowed	 the	 pulverized	 food.	 “It's	 something	 to	 eat.”	 I placed	 another	 spoonful	 in	 my	 mouth.	 B2	 watched	 with	 an	 expression</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere	 between	 curiosity	 and	 disgust.	 “You	 better	 eat.”	 I	 jutted	 my	 chin toward	the	cereal	box	I'd	left	on	the	cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	the	m-milk	good?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“It's	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-not	sour?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	you	say	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	shrugged.	“I	d-don't	know.	Why	did	you	s-smell	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	and	shrugged.	“It's	fine.	It's	not	that	cold,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	wrinkled	her	nose	again.	She	sighed	and	rose	to	her	feet.	Standing	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cart,	 she	 reached	 for	 the	 box	 of	 cereal.	 She	 stared	 at	 it	 for	 a	 moment	 before pouring	some	into	her	bowl.	By	the	sound	of	the	clinking,	I	was	sure	she	didn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	as	much	as	I	had,	and	I	had	taken	little.	She	opened	her	carton	of	milk	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">poured	it	over	the	cereal	before	returning	to	her	mat.	I	watched	her	with	as	much</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>intensity	as	she	had	me.	She	allowed	one	small	puff	to	float	onto	her	spoon	and raised	it	to	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	not	going	to	kill	you,”	I	teased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	might,”	she	replied.	She	sucked	the	spoonful	of	milk	and	the	one	puff	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cereal	 into	 her	 mouth.	 She	 chewed,	 and	 her	 face	 contorted	 into	 several expressions	of	distaste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 not	  <i class="calibre3">that</i>	 bad,”	 I	 said.	 I	 placed	 another	 spoonful	 into	 my	 mouth.	 The puffed	pieces	had	soaked	up	more	milk	and	were	soggy.	I	swallowed	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mashed	bits	and	scrunched	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	said	it	w-wasn't	bad,”	B2	said	as	she	placed	her	spoon	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	her	bowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“If	you	don't	like	it	now,	you're	going	to	hate	it	if	you	let	it	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">soggy.	Eat	it	fast.”	I	scooped	up	a	large	spoonful	and	filled	my	mouth.	I	chewed, swallowed	the	mush,	and	stopped	a	gag	as	it	slid	down	my	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	we	were	b-back	at	C.E.C.I.L,”	B2	said	as	she	shovelled	a	spoonful</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	her	mouth.	A	strand	of	her	hair,	still	attached	to	her	head,	ended	up	between her	lips.	She	pulled	it	free	from	the	corner	of	her	mouth	and	swallowed	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">chewing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 going	 to	 choke	 if	 you	 don't	 chew	 it,”	 I	 scolded	 as	 I	 prepared	 to swallow	another	soggy	mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya,	'cause	you	g-gagging	on	the	mush	is	so	much	b-better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 swallowed	 the	 last	 bite	 and	 set	 my	 bowl	 and	 spoon	 down	 on	 the	 floor beside	me.	My	body	shook.	“Eww!	That	was	awful.”	I	wiped	my	mouth	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	of	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn't	that	b-bad.”	B2	placed	her	empty	bowl	beside	her	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	widened	as	did	my	mouth.	“You're	kidding?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup!	That	was	d-disgusting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Something	tells	me	we	better	get	used	to	it.”	I	stared	at	the	cart</p>
<p class="calibre1">parked	near	the	invisible	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	had	grown	much	lighter,	and	I	was	able	to	inspect	the	details	that	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost	in	the	shadows	earlier.	As	guessed,	the	space	was	not	much	larger	than	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	room	and	was	quite	empty.	The	only	furnishing	was	a	tall,	wooden	cabinet.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	as	though	on	guard	against	the	back	wall	under	the	round,	dirty	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted	in	the	sunlight.	We'd	grown	accustomed	to	the	simulated	sun,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 real	 thing	 was	 different.	 I	 crawled	 over	 to	 where	 the	 sunglasses	 sat	 on	 the floor	and	picked	them	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	 you	 better	 put	 these	 on,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 sat	 back	 down	 on	 my	 mat	 and held	 a	 pair	 out	 to	 my	 sister.	 She	 was	 busy	 playing	 with	 a	 lock	 of	 her	 hair, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>twirling	 and	 twisting	 it	 around	 her	 finger.	 The	 action	 reminded	 me	 that	 it	 had been	a	habit	of	hers	for	a	long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	 n-need	 them.	 It's	 not	 that	 b-bright.”	 She	 pulled	 her	 finger	 free,	 and her	hair	remained	in	a	tight	curl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	because	you're	too	busy	playing	to	notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine!”	 She	 reached	 out	 and	 snatched	 the	 glasses	 from	 my	 hand.	 “Happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">now?”	 She	 placed	 them	 on	 her	 face.	 I	 stifled	 a	 laugh.	 They	 were	 too	 large	 for her,	 and	 she	 looked	 like	 a	 bug.	 “Yours	 look	 funny,	 too.”	 She	 squinted	 and grimaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	and	pushed	the	glasses,	which	had	slipped	down	my	nose,	back	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">place.	 I	 stared	 past	 B2	 and	 resumed	 my	 examination	 of	 the	 cabinet.	 It	 hadn't exactly	 been	 a	 surprise.	 My	 toe	 had	 already	 made	 contact	 with	 it	 during	 my earlier	half-blind	inspection	of	the	room.	I	wiggled	it	as	the	memory	came	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	 the	 dark	 glasses,	 my	 eyes	 narrowed	 in	 thought.  <i class="calibre3">I	 wonder	 if	 there's</i> <i class="calibre3">anything	 inside. </i>	 I	 stared	 at	 the	 cabinet,	 my	 mind	 preoccupied	 with	 its	 possible contents.	A	flash	of	movement	in	my	peripheral	vision	distracted	me	and	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	attention	toward	B2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha	ar	u	starin'	at?”	B2	sputtered;	her	mouth	was	full	of	dry	cereal,	and	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	reached	in	for	another	scoop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 are	 you	 doing?”	 I	 said	 wide-eyed	 as	 B2	 tilted	 her	 head	 back	 and dropped	a	few	more	pieces	of	cereal	into	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 looked	 at	 me;	 her	 icy	 blue	 eyes	 sparkled	 with	 mischief,	 and	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrugged.	“They	t-taste	way	better	d-dry.”	She	smiled	and	stuck	her	hand	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	box	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	have	it?”	I	reached	for	the	cereal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait	your	t-turn,”	B2	grumbled	and	pulled	the	box	out	of	my	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 might	 be	 all	 the	 food	 we're	 getting	 today,”	 I	 said	 and	 pointed	 to	 the cereal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	looked	at	the	carton	she	held	in	her	hands.	“No.	That's	not	p-possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	devoured	another	handful.	She	picked	up	a	few	pieces	that	landed	on	her	lap</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	popped	them	into	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn't	C.E.C.I.L,”	I	reminded	her,	my	hand	still	outstretched	and	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	groaned.	“Fine,	but	I	h-hope	you're	wrong.”	She	shoved	the	box	into	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	hope	so	too. </i>	I	set	the	cereal	on	the	floor	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 didn't	 answer	 m-my	 question,”	 B2	 said	 as	 she	 resumed	 the	 habit	 of twirling	her	dark	waves. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>I	 pressed	 my	 fingertips	 to	 my	 forehead	 for	 a	 moment	 before	 her	 cereal-sputtered	 question	 came	 back	 to	 mind.	 “I'm	 staring	 at	 that.”	 I	 pointed	 over	 her shoulder	toward	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	stopped	playing	with	her	hair	and	turned	herself	around.	“D-do	you	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">there's	anything	in	it?”	Her	voice	rose	with	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	it's	locked.”	I	shrugged	and	pointed	out	the	small	lock	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	 of	 the	 cabinet	 doors.	 “Let's	 see	 if	 we	 can	 move	 it.”	 I	 stood	 up	 and	 walked toward	the	wardrobe	as	an	idea	came	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	B2	crossed	her	arms	and	remained	seated	on	her	mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we	can	tell	if	it's	empty.”	I	had	another	reason	for	moving	it.	If	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 pull	 it	 away	 from	 the	 wall,	 it	 would	 provide	 some	 privacy	 for	 our makeshift	 toilets.	 The	 thought	 of	 having	 to	 go	 in	 buckets	 was	 bad	 enough,	 let alone	out	in	the	middle	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	moved	to	the	side	of	the	cabinet,	placed	my	left	hand	on	the	back	corner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 my	 right	 on	 the	 front.	 The	 large,	 wooden	 box	 was	 wide	 enough	 to	 fill	 my outstretched	 arms	 as	 I	 hugged	 the	 side.	 “Can	 you	 please	 help?”	 I	 pleaded.	 B2</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	still	seated	and	didn't	look	like	she	planned	on	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 groaned	 and	 trudged	 toward	 me.	 My	 sister	 made	 her	 reluctance	 quite clear,	and	she	didn't	try	to	hide	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grab	the	other	side,	we'll	try	to	move	it	forward,”	I	instructed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	large	piece	of	furniture	rested	tight	to	the	wall,	and	it	was	impossible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	a	good	grip.	After	several	minutes	of	struggling,	the	wardrobe	hadn't	moved, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	both	of	our	faces	were	red	from	the	effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget	 it,	 it's	 too	 heavy,”	 I	 panted	 and	 wiped	 the	 sweat	 from	 my	 forehead with	 the	 back	 of	 my	 hand.	 I	 lifted	 my	 damp	 hair	 off	 the	 nape	 of	 my	 neck	 and fanned	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!”	 B2	 walked	 over	 to	 her	 mat	 and	 plopped	 herself	 down;	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunglasses	almost	popped	off	her	face.	A	few	seconds	later,	I	joined	her	on	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mat.	We	sat	without	speaking	and	stared	at	the	wooden	sentry.	Once	in	a	while, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	gaze	travelled	up	toward	the	window.	After	a	few	seconds,	I	moved	over	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mat,	and	B2	turned	her	back	to	the	large	piece	of	furniture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	really	hope	J	lets	us	out	s-soon,	'cause	this	room	is	full	of	n-nothing	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 st-stupid	 cabinet.”	 B2	 jutted	 her	 thumb	 behind	 her	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 the only	furnishing	in	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 stomach	 tightened.	 As	 much	 as	 I	 wanted	 to	 get	 out	 of	 there,	 a	 voice inside	my	head	told	me	that	wasn't	happening	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	spent	the	rest	of	the	morning	lying	on	our	thin	blue	mats.	B2	drifted	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	out	of	sleep	with	her	sunglasses	still	resting	on	her	face,	while	I	stared	up	at the	rafters.	I	couldn't	sleep;	my	mind	was	too	busy.	Memories	tried	their	best	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>catch	my	attention,	but	I	pushed	them	aside.	There	were	more	important	things to	worry	about,	one	of	which	was	our	current	state	of	imprisonment.	We	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	plan	–	or	several. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	on	the	list	was	getting	a	look	out	the	window.	I	was	sure	B2	wouldn't	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	 to	 boost	 me	 up	 to	 the	 top	 of	 the	 wardrobe.	 I	 wasn't	 big	 or	 tall,	 but	 I	 was larger	than	my	sister.	It	would	have	to	be	B2.	My	second	plan	involved	opening</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	closet.	A	flat,	metal	bar	ran	across	the	top	and	secured	the	two	doors	with	a lock.	I	imagined	somehow	prying	it	open	at	the	bottom	if	only	enough	to	peek</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside.	Last,	and	of	course	the	most	important,	was	a	plan	for	escape,	should	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">determine	that	our	new	home	was	a	prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recalled	a	word	etched	into	my	memory.	It	was	a	single,	yellow	highlighted</p>
<p class="calibre1">term	in	a	textbook	that	had	spurred	a	thought	-	a	fleeting	idea.	At	C.E.C.I.L,	it seemed	impossible.	But	our	new	location	had	a	window.	We	were	in	a	room	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	no	cameras	watching	our	every	move;	it	was	enticing	-	the	idea	had	new	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	and	stared	up	at	the	window	-	at	the	possibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">But	what	if	J	has	gotten	us	out?	What	if	this	place	is	where	we	escaped	to? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	 if	 this	 is	 only	 temporary?	 We	 have	 to	 wait. </i>	 I	 nodded,	 agreeing	 with	 my thoughts.	We	needed	to	know	for	sure.	My	gut	knotted	as	sweat	beaded	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">forehead	 and	 trickled	 down	 my	 nose,	 taking	 my	 glasses	 with	 it.	 My	 heartbeat quickened	 along	 with	 my	 breaths.	 Every	 inch	 of	 my	 body	 tingled,	 and	 the	 hair stood	 up	 on	 the	 back	 of	 my	 neck.  <i class="calibre3">What	 if	 we	 waited	 too	 long?	 What	 if	 we</i> <i class="calibre3">escaped? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thought	of	escape	brought	with	it	an	uneasiness	of	its	own	that	confused</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 I'd	 never	 had	 to	 worry	 about	 those	 things	 before	 -	 before	 I	 only	 existed.	 I missed	 C.E.C.I.L.	 I	 missed	 my	 room,	 my	 few	 things.	 B2's	 statement	 echoed	 in my	ears;	our	new	room	was	full	of	nothing.	We	had	no	desk,	no	books,	no	beds, </p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 bathroom,	 no	 clothes,	 no	 food	 –	 no	 camera.	 I	 turned	 around	 and	 looked	 at each	empty	corner	in	the	room.	Despite	the	camera,	C.E.C.I.L	could	almost	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 heaven	 compared	 to	 our	 latest	 surroundings.	 I	 pushed	 my	 glasses	 up	 and lay	back	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a><b class="calibre4">Fifteen	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">2029</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	this	place?”	B2's	sleepy	voice	interrupted	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	my	head	in	time	to	see	her	waving	her	hand	at	the	rafters.	I	sniffed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 warm,	 musty	 air.	 “A	 barn,	 I	 think.”	 It	 was	 the	 only	 description	 I	 had	 that made	sense	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	said	the	word	out	loud,	my	mind	drifted	to	C.E.C.I.L	and	the	variety	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">books	I'd	read.	One,	in	particular,	had	been	my	favourite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 closed	 my	 eyes,	 and	 the	 image	 of	 the	 cover	 came	 to	 mind	 –	  <i class="calibre3">Charlotte's</i> <i class="calibre3">Web</i>.	 The	 book	 had	 drawn	 me	 to	 its	 pages.	 The	 words	 inside	 offered	 a comfortable	 familiarity.	 At	 the	 time,	 I	 hadn't	 remembered	 why	 it	 had	 meant	 so much.	And	while	a	lot	of	my	memories	hadn't	returned,	some	were	beginning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">peak	through	the	fog	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 turned	 nine,	 my	 grandmother	 gave	 me	 a	 hard	 copy	 of	  <i class="calibre3">Charlotte's</i> <i class="calibre3">Web. </i>	It	was	exciting	as	most	of	the	chapter	books	I'd	read	had	been	digital.	This real	book	became	my	favourite.	When	I	finished	reading	it,	I	would	flip	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	front	and	begin	again.	I	could	not	recall	my	grandmother's	face,	but	the	book easily	came	to	mind.	My	eyes	popped	open	–	 <i class="calibre3">Charlotte's	Web</i>	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bits	 of	 dust	 danced	 in	 the	 sunbeam	 that	 shone	 through	 the	 window	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bounced	off	the	rafters.  <i class="calibre3">Is	this	really	a	barn? </i>	I	sniffed	again.	The	faint	smell	of wood,	dirt	and	something	else	crept	into	my	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	barn?”	B2's	voice	interrupted	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	–	a	place	where	farm	animals	live.”	I	put	my	hands	behind	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	and	rested	it	in	my	laced	fingers.	My	eyes	fixed	on	the	rafters.  <i class="calibre3">Or	 human</i> <i class="calibre3">animals</i>,	my	mind	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	a	b-barn	is.	But	why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	my	head	back	and	forth	on	the	mat.	“I	don't	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 listened	 to	 the	 sounds	 in	 the	 room.	 Each	 noise	 had	 its	 rhythm	 –	 our breathing,	the	creaking	floorboards,	and	a	distant	and	indistinct	melody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 focused	 on	 the	 tune,	 the	 imaginings	 of	 chirps	 and	 peeps.	 I	 thought	 the memory	of	recorded	birds	and	insects	from	the	simulated	forest	had	come	to	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 up,	 excited	 by	 the	 realization	 that	 what	 I	 heard	 was	 real.	 The	 melody reminded	me	of	the	world	that	waited	for	us	beyond	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on.”	 I	 grabbed	 B2's	 hand,	 pulled	 her	 up	 off	 her	 mat,	 and	 almost dragged	her	to	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April,	you're	h-hurting	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 focused	 my	 attention	 on	 my	 hand	 and	 felt	 my	 sister's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>squeezed	inside.	I	released	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	going	to	boost	you	up	to	the	top	of	the	cabinet.”	I	smiled	at	B2	who	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbed	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged	and	looked	up	at	the	wardrobe.	“Why	d-don't	you	go	up	there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	looks	a	little	high	for	m-me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 not	 that	 high.	 Anyway,	 you'll	 get	 to	 see	 what's	 outside	 the	 window.”	 I hoped	the	suggestion	would	be	enough	to	entice	her	and	erase	any	fears	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	climbing	onto	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	smiled	back.	”Okay.”	She	placed	a	hand	on	the	wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laced	my	fingers	together	and	made	a	step	for	her.	“At	the	count	of	three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	nodded.	The	smile	on	her	face	disappeared,	and	a	strange	look	came	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	 I	 couldn't	 tell	 if	 it	 was	 fear,	 determination,	 or	 a	 little	 bit	 of	 both,	 though	 I suspected	it	was	more	a	look	of	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere	in	my	head,	there	was	a	memory	of	B2	and	a	phobia	of	heights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn't	quite	grasp	the	details,	but	I	knew	it	to	be	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	placed	her	right	foot	in	my	hands	and	stretched	her	arms	up	as	far	as	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 on	 the	 cabinet.	 They	 didn't	 quite	 reach	 the	 top;	 it	 was	 still	 about	 a	 foot away.	But,	a	good	push	would	fix	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One,	two	–	three,”	I	grunted	and	heaved	her	with	all	the	strength	I	had.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">grabbed	the	top	of	the	cabinet;	her	legs	kicked	and	squirmed.	I	stood	on	tip-toe, pushed	on	her	bottom,	and	shoved	her	higher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	tense	seconds,	B2	managed	to	pull	herself	up	the	wardrobe.	All</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	while	her	feet	searched	for	a	foothold.	Finally,	she	pulled	her	left	foot	up,	and it	rested	on	the	rusted,	metal	bar	where	a	lock	held	the	doors	together.	She	drew herself	the	rest	of	the	way	and	landed	on	top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	half-smile	crossed	B2's	face,	and	she	gave	the	thumbs-up	signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	the	matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	higher	than	you	th-think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	what	you	see;	it'll	keep	your	mind	off	of	it.”	I	couldn't	wait	for	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	describe	the	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	 crawled	 to	 the	 window	 and	 wiped	 it	 with	 her	 hand.	 She	 cleared	 away what	must	have	been	years	of	dirt.	“Wow!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WHAT?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!”	She	turned	and	scolded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.	What	is	it?”	I	spoke	in	a	quieter	voice.	My	fingers	tapped	on	my	chin</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	nervous	energy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	stared	out	the	window	for	what	seemed	like	forever.	Finally,	she	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	smile.	“Trees!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>“Trees?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“L-lots	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	her	head	from	left	to	right.	“Nope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me	and	rolled	her	eyes.	“Of	c-course,	I'm	sure.	I'm	not	an	i-</p>
<p class="calibre1">idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lots	of	them,”	I	said	more	to	myself	in	resignation.	I	rubbed	my	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	the	matter	with	t-trees?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	it's	just	that…”	I	closed	my	eyes	and	shook	my	head	as	I	pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	lips	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	The	irritation	in	B2's	voice	caused	my	eyes	to	pop	open.	I	stared	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	her	as	she	knelt	on	the	top	of	the	cabinet.	Her	head	was	inches	away	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rafters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	in	a	forest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And…”	B2's	eyebrows	rose	to	meet	her	hairline	as	she	waited	for	more	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	we	have	to	leave…”	Again	I	let	my	words	trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 might	 not	 find	 our	 way,”	 B2	 finished	 and	 sat	 down	 with	 her	 legs</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangling	over	the	edge	of	the	cabinet.	She	sighed.	“I'm	coming	d-down	n-now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I've	been	up	here	t-too	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	need	help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	shook	her	head,	turned	around,	and	lowered	herself	until	she	hung	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	fingers.	She	let	go	and	landed	on	her	feet	with	a	soft	thump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 B2's	 help,	 I	 had	 accomplished	 my	 first	 task.	 And	 although	 the	 result wasn't	 what	 I	 hoped	 for,	 I	 was	 at	 least	 glad	 that	 she	 got	 to	 see	 the	 outside.	 I stared	up	at	the	window,	next	time	I	would	have	a	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	morning	went	on,	we	sat	on	our	mats	and	made	plans.	We	recounted</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 memory	 that	 had	 surfaced	 in	 our	 heads,	 no	 matter	 how	 strange	 or	 out	 of place	they	seemed.	As	it	turned	out,	B2	had	about	as	much	recall	of	our	family</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	did,	complete	with	blurred	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	it	just	us?”	I	placed	our	empty	lunch	plates	on	the	cart.	J	had	brought	more food	 but	 nothing	 else;	 his	 brief	 visit	 did	 not	 allow	 for	 any	 more	 questions.	 I returned	to	my	mat	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	tangled	a	wavy	lock	of	her	chocolate	hair	around	her	finger.	She	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	knees	up	close	to	her	chest,	her	bare	feet	planted	on	the	floor.	Her	sunglasses sat	 beside	 her	 on	 her	 mat.	 She	 looked	 up	 at	 me;	 her	 chin	 had	 reddened	 from resting	it	on	the	top	of	her	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>“What	do	you	m-mean?”	She	stopped	twirling	her	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shifted	 from	 my	 crossed	 leg	 position	 and	 pulled	 my	 knees	 up	 like	 B2's.	 I wrapped	my	arms	around	my	legs	and	laced	my	fingers.	“I	mean	just	you	and	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	our	parents.	No	one	else? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 thoughtful	 look	 crossed	 my	 sister's	 face	 as	 she	 tilted	 her	 head	 back	 and looked	up	at	the	rafters.	“I	don't	know.	I	want	to	s-say	yes	but…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	think	there's	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	nodded.	“Do	you	th-think	there's	someone	else?”	Her	icy	eyes	stared	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know.	Sometimes	I	think…I	don't	know.”	I	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 unwrapped	 my	 arms	 from	 around	 my	 legs	 and	 placed	 them	 behind	 me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">supporting	 myself	 on	 my	 hands.	 The	 rough,	 wooden	 floor	 scratched	 at	 my palms.	I	stretched	my	legs	out	and	wiggled	my	bare	toes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">When	was	J	bringing	us	our	clothes? </i>	I	looked	up	at	the	dirty	window.	The sunlight	 no	 longer	 shone	 directly	 into	 the	 room.	 I	 reached	 up,	 pulled	 off	 my sunglasses,	and	blinked	a	few	times.	B2	was	right;	the	light	didn't	hurt.	I	closed my	eyes	and	tilted	my	head	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	g-get	that?”	B2's	voice	interrupted	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	 what?”	 I	 said.	 I	 tipped	 my	 head	 forward	 and	 opened	 my	 eyes.	 My</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions	reminded	me	of	an	old	doll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That?”	B2	pointed	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	drew	my	eyebrows	together.  <i class="calibre3">What	is	she	talking	about? </i>	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">B2	grumbled	a	little	and	crawled	toward	me.	She	knelt	beside	my	left	thigh</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	reached	out	with	one	of	her	long	fingers	toward	my	neck.	She	scooped	up	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">delicate	 gold	 chain	 from	 underneath	 the	 rounded	 collar	 of	 my	 nightgown.	 My eyes	widened	as	it	lengthened	and	pulled	free	from	underneath	the	fabric.	She	let the	chain	drop,	and	a	golden	heart	fell	against	my	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tucked	 my	 chin	 under	 and	 bent	 my	 head	 forward	 to	 get	 a	 better	 look.	 I reached	down	and	held	up	the	heart	between	my	fingers.	“Where	did	this	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">from?”	I	did	not	recognize	the	piece	of	jewelry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	j-just	what	I	was	asking	you.	W-when	you	tilted	your	h-head	back;	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	s-something	shiny	on	your	n-neck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn't	know	it	was	there.	I	mean	I	can't	feel	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D-did	you	have	it	b-before	–	at	C.E.C.I.L?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	closed	my	eyes	and	saw	my	reflection	in	the	bathroom	mirror.	I	shook	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	“No,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	creaking	startled	me.	I	let	out	a	small	gasp	and	whirled	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chain	around	my	neck	was	for	the	moment	forgotten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	the	light	does	not	bother	your	eyes,”	J	said	as	he	stood	in	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>Dark	 sunglasses	 still	 covered	 his,	 and	 a	 white	 mask	 was	 over	 his	 nose	 and mouth.	He	held	a	large	box.	I	tried	to	look	past	him	and	out	into	the	hall,	but	I could	not	see	around	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	It's	fine.”	I	shrugged.	J's	glasses	were	so	dark	that	I	could	not	make	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 brought	 you	 some	 clothing	 and	 dinner.	 Sorry,	 it	 took	 me	 so	 long.”	 J</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhaled	a	sharp	breath	and	coughed	a	few	times	as	he	set	the	box	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	folded	my	arms	and	took	a	step	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!”	He	held	out	his	hand.	“You	must	not	come	any	closer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 not?	 Are	 you	 sick?	 What's	 going	 on	 J?	 Where	 are	 we?	 Why	 are	 we here?	Who	are	you?	Are	you	going	to	let	us	go?	What's	happened?”	My	mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">spewed	 out	 questions	 faster	 than	 my	 brain	 could	 register	 my	 thoughts.	 My cheeks	grew	warmer	with	each	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya!”	B2's	voice	boomed	beside	me	and	made	me	jump.	“W-what	she	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">J's	eyes	widened	as	he	looked	at	B2.	His	whole	body	slumped	in	resignation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 will	 answer	 all	 your	 questions,	 but	 I	 cannot	 answer	 them	 all	 right	 now.”	 He cleared	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	answer	one	for	me…please?”	I	begged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	sighed	and	nodded.	“Which	question?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	any	that	I	asked.	I	have	another	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	J	leaned	against	the	wall	behind	him	as	though	standing	tired	him	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	this	come	from?”	I	held	out	the	necklace	around	my	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	wearing	it	the	night	you	came	back	to	C.E.C.I.L.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Back? </i>	My	mind	questioned,	but	the	thought	was	fleeting.	I	looked	down	at the	small	heart	that	dangled	from	the	chain	below	my	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	when	was	that?”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 all	 depends.	 For	 three	 years	 you	 lived	 at	 C.E.C.I.L	 with	 the	 rest	 of your	 family.	 You	 came	 and	 went	 as	 you	 pleased,	 sometimes	 not	 returning	 for days	or	weeks.	Then	one	night	everything	changed,	and	you	became	permanent</p>
<p class="calibre1">residents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	face	twisted	into	one	of	incomprehension.	I	had	no	recollection	of	any	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	 B2	 gasped	 as	 she	 grabbed	 my	 arm	 and	 squeezed	 it.	 I	 shut	 my	 eyes	 and concentrated.	I	willed	myself	to	remember	the	last	memory	I	had	before	oblivion</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	it	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Flashes	 of	 brilliant	 and	 colourful	 fireworks	 illuminated	 the	 night	 sky.	 The</i> <i class="calibre3">resulting	boom	so	loud	it	resonated	in	my	chest.	I	turned	my	head	to	the	right;</i> <i class="calibre3">glowing	numbers	signifying	the	year	sparkled	in	the	dark. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	year	is	it?”	I	said	as	my	eyes	popped	open	to	the	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	only	had	one	question.”	J	folded	his	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>I	shrugged.	“What.	Year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“2029.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	lost	five	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a><b class="calibre4">Sixteen	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">My	Sister's	Name</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">It's	 beautiful!”	 I	 gushed.	 The	 gold	 chain	 hung	 from	 my	 fingers;	 the	 heart</i> <i class="calibre3">dangled.	It	glinted	in	the	morning	sunlight	that	filtered	in	through	my	bedroom</i> <i class="calibre3">window. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">We're	glad	you	like	it,”	Mom	said	from	her	spot	on	my	bed.	She	wadded	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">yellow	flowered	wrapping	paper	up	in	her	hands. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Remember	to	look	after	it,”	Dad	said.	He	stood	by	mom;	his	hand	rested	on</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">her	shoulder. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I	will.”	I	smiled	and	looked	back	at	my	gift.	The	gold	heart	was	perfect	in</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">every	way. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Are	 you	 surprised?”	 Mom	 said.	 Her	 smile	 showed	 off	 her	 white	 and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">straight	teeth. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Yes,	very!”	I	shifted	back	a	little	and	leaned	against	my	headboard.	Mom's</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">hand	rested	on	my	lower	leg.	Even	through	the	blankets,	I	could	feel	the	warmth</i> <i class="calibre3">of	 her	 touch.	 A	 broad	 smile	 stretched	 across	 my	 face.	 “I	 thought	 gold	 was</i> <i class="calibre3">expensive.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">It	is,”	my	father	said,	“but	you're	worth	it.”	He	smiled. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“You're	thirteen,	now,”	Mom	said.	“We	expect	you'll	take	care	of	it.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“I	 will.”	 The	 smile	 disappeared	 from	 my	 face.	 “What	 about	 Ben?	 She's</i> <i class="calibre3">going	to	want	one	for	her	birthday	too.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Ben	will	only	be	ten;	she'll	have	to	understand	she	has	to	wait,”	my	mother</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">said. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">But	what	if	gold	gets	more	expensive? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Don't	worry,	Av.	We	already	thought	of	that	and	bought	her	one,	too.”	Dad</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">smiled.	“But	she	still	has	to	wait,”	he	added. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">She'll	love	it	as	much	as	I	do.”	I	leaned	forward	and	hugged	my	mom.	Dad</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">brushed	a	kiss	on	the	top	of	my	head. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Remember,	it's	a	secret,”	Mom	said	as	I	broke	away	from	her	hug.	“Let	me</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">help	you	put	it	on.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	handed	my	mother	the	necklace	and	pulled	my	long,	brown	hair	out	of	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">way.	Her	warm	fingers	tickled	as	she	fastened	the	chain	around	my	neck. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Beautiful!”	she	said. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	sat	up	and	tucked	my	chin	in;	the	gold	heart	hung	from	its	chain	and	rested</i> <i class="calibre3">on	my	upper	chest.	“Don't	worry;	I	can	keep	a	secret	for	three	years.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">We're	counting	on	it,”	Dad	said. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Okay!	 I	 have	 a	 birthday	 party	 to	 finish	 preparing	 for;	 you	 have	 guests</i> <i class="calibre3">coming	in	two	hours.”	Mom	swept	a	lock	of	hair	from	my	face. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>“<i class="calibre3">Two	 hours?”	 I	 flung	 back	 the	 blankets.	 “What	 time	 is	 it?”	 I	 wiped	 at	 my</i> <i class="calibre3">eyes. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Ten	o'clock,”	Dad	said.	“We	let	you	sleep	in.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Don't	 worry.”	 Mom	 kissed	 my	 forehead.	 “You	 have	 two	 hours,	 plenty	 of</i> <i class="calibre3">time.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">But	 what	 about	 the	 decorations	 and	 everything?”	 It	 was	 my	 first	 boy/girl</i> <i class="calibre3">party,	and	I	wanted	everything	to	be	perfect. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">We	followed	your	instructions	to	the	letter,”	Dad	said. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	narrowed	my	eyes.	“You	found	my	notes?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Of	course,	right	on	my	desk,	open	to	where	you	left	off.	It's	where	you	fell</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">asleep	 last	 night,	 with	 your	 cheek	 pasted	 to	 your	 notebook.	 I'm	 surprised	 the</i> <i class="calibre3">marks	 are	 gone.”	 Dad	 reached	 over	 and	 placed	 his	 hand	 under	 my	 chin	 and</i> <i class="calibre3">turned	my	head. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What	marks?”	I	reached	up	and	rubbed	my	hand	over	my	left	cheek. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The	 spiral	 rings	 from	 the	 old	 notebook	 left	 quite	 an	 impression.	 Your</i> <i class="calibre3">mother	and	I	were	sure	they'd	still	be	there	in	the	morning. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">My	jaw	dropped. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Don't	worry,”	Mom	said.	“We	both	knew,”	she	gave	dad	a	light	slap	on	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">arm,	“that	the	marks	would	be	gone.	I	did	take	a	picture,	though.”	She	smiled. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Get	ready!”	Mom	said	as	she	and	dad	left	my	room	and	closed	the	door	behind</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">them. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 rubbed	 over	 my	 cheek	 a	 second	 time	 and	 sighed	 when	 my	 fingers	 traced</i> <i class="calibre3">over	smooth,	unmarked	skin. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 jumped	 from	 my	 bed	 and	 stared	 at	 my	 reflection	 in	 the	 mirror	 above	 my</i> <i class="calibre3">dresser.	I	was	a	teenager.	I	smiled,	and	the	brown-haired	girl	with	the	blue	eyes</i> <i class="calibre3">returned	the	grin.	The	gold	heart	nestled	close	to	my	chest. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Bethany!”	I	heard	my	mother's	voice	call	through	my	closed	door. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	 woke	 to	 a	 dim	 room,	 and	 my	 hand	 went	 to	 my	 neck.	 I	 removed	 the	 necklace from	under	my	nightgown	and	curled	my	fingers	around	the	heart.	The	sound	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	parents'	voices	rang	in	my	ears.	Their	faces	were	still	a	blur,	but	their	voices were	as	clear	as	though	they'd	spoken	seconds	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	lay	in	front	of	me,	sound	asleep.	The	memory	of	her	name	was	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp	and	crisp	as	if	I	read	it	on	a	piece	of	paper.	I	remembered.	Her	name	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany,	though	sometimes	we	called	her	Ben.  <i class="calibre3">Why? </i>	 I	 wondered	 as	 I	 stared	 at her	sleeping	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 memory	 of	 my	 dream	 still	 lingered	 in	 my	 mind.	 I	 reached	 down	 and searched	for	the	thin	blanket	at	my	feet.	I	found	it,	pulled	it	up	over	my	shoulder, and	tucked	it	under	my	chin.	I	snuggled	and	hoped	to	return	to	my	dream	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>memory	of	my	parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	right	hip	ached	as	it	pushed	through	the	thin	mat	and	into	the	hard	floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	couldn't	roll	the	other	way.	I'd	remembered	my	sister's	name	and	facing	her made	me	feel	much	closer.	I	closed	my	eyes	and	tried	not	to	focus	on	the	pain	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	hip,	but	on	my	dream	instead.	If	I	could	return,	I	believed	I	would	learn	more than	my	sister's	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyelids	fluttered	open	to	a	much	brighter	room	and	an	empty	mat	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	I	squinted	and	grabbed	for	my	sunglasses.	A	sudden	noise	behind	me	caught</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bethany!”	 I	 bolted	 upright,	 and	 my	 head	 spun	 with	 my	 quick	 and	 sudden movement.	 I	 rested	 my	 forehead	 in	 my	 palms	 and	 waited	 for	 the	 room	 to	 stop spinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over	 here.”	 Her	 voice	 called	 from	 behind	 me.	 “Wait,	 what	 did	 you	 c-call me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	around	and	found	her	sitting	in	a	chair	at	a	table,	eating	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wide	eyes	replaced	the	grin	on	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	did	that	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	c-call	me?”	Bethany	said	with	her	mouth	full	of	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	my	sister.	Her	left	hand	held	a	spoon	inches	away	from	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	been	mid-bite.	“I	called	you,	Bethany.”	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	dropped	the	spoon.	It	clanked	as	it	fell	back	into	the	bowl	sitting	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	table	in	front	of	her.	“Why?”	She	narrowed	her	eyes.	“W-why	B-Bethany	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	B2?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	your	name.”	I	stood	up	from	the	mat	and	walked	toward	the	table.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	rubbed	along	the	back	of	the	wooden	chair	in	front	of	me.	“Now,	when	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 get	 here?”	 I	 looked	 down	 at	 my	 sister.	 She'd	 sat	 back	 in	 her	 chair	 and folded	her	arms	across	her	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know?”	She	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed	and	pulled	the	chair	out	from	under	the	table	before	sitting	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.	 My	 muscles	 relaxed,	 surprising	 me	 at	 how	 good	 it	 felt	 to	 sit	 in	 a	 chair rather	than	on	the	floor.	“I	dreamed	it.”	I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pfft!”	Bethany	leaned	forward	and	picked	up	her	spoon	from	her	bowl.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	 the	 food	 inside	 a	 stir.	 The	 warm	 smell	 of	 maple	 and	 brown	 sugar	 wafted toward	my	nose,	and	my	mouth	watered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	oatmeal?”	I	pointed	to	her	bowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	nodded	and	brought	another	spoonful	to	her	mouth.	“It's	good,	too,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	through	the	gooey	bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 table	 sat	 a	 small,	 covered	 tray.	 I	 removed	 the	 lid,	 and	 a	 warm, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>comforting	smell	greeted	me.	I	breathed	in	deep	and	reveled	in	the	sweet	aroma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	true,	you	know.”	I	picked	up	the	warm	bowl	and	placed	it	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	 name	  <i class="calibre3">is</i>	 Bethany.”	 I	 dug	 into	 my	 oatmeal	 and	 put	 the	 spoon	 in	 my mouth.	 I	 sucked	 the	 warm	 mush	 off	 the	 spoon	 and	 let	 it	 sit	 on	 my	 tongue	 as	 I savoured	the	sweetness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	dropped	her	spoon	in	her	bowl	again	and	folded	her	arms.	Her	nose</p>
<p class="calibre1">crinkled	 and	 her	 eyebrows	 drew	 together.	 “It	 d-doesn't	 sound	 right.	 How	 d-do you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed;	 I	 was	 about	 to	 take	 another	 bite	 but	 placed	 the	 spoon	 back	 in	 the bowl.	My	stomach	growled	with	anger.	If	it	had	hands	of	its	own,	it	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped	 itself.	 “I	 had	 a	 dream	 or	 a	 memory.	 It	 was	 my	 birthday	 and	 mom	 and dad…”	 I	 reached	 up	 and	 pulled	 my	 necklace	 from	 underneath	 my	 nightgown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom	and	dad	gave	me	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany's	eyes	widened.	“D-did	you	see	their	faces?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 really,	 not	 clear,	 except	 for	 maybe	 their	 smiles.”	 I	 shrugged,	 unsure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	heard	their	voices,	and	I	still	can.	I	remember	exactly	what	they	sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	dropped	her	gaze	to	the	floor.	Her	expression	of	surprise	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	unmistakable	sadness.	“I	wish	I	remembered,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will.”	I	reached	over	and	patted	the	top	of	my	sister's	hand.	“Anyway,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	mom	calling	for	you.	She	yelled	Bethany.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	me?”	Bethany's	eyes	brightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 you	 weren't	 in	 my	 dream,	 just	 your	 name.”	 I	 remembered	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	I'd	had	with	my	parents,	and	the	promise	I	had	made.	That	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">six	 years	 ago.	 And	 though	 there	 was	 no	 reason	 to	 keep	 the	 promise,	 there	 was also	no	need	to	mention	it.	It	was	all	in	the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 eyes	 fixed	 on	 the	 face	 of	 my	 sixteen-year-old	 sister.	 Learning	 we	 had lost	 time,	 was	 still	 a	 shock.	 I	 was	 no	 longer	 the	 thirteen-year-old	 girl	 I remembered	but	a	young	woman	I	did	not	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	you	d-didn't	see	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	how	do	you	even	know	it	was	m-me	they	were	calling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once	I	heard	it	in	my	dream,	I	knew	it	was	true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	w-wish	I	remembered.”	Her	voice	cracked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sudden	thought	came	to	my	mind.	“What	about,	Ben?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ben.	Dad	and	I	both	called	you	that	in	my	dream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I	wasn't	in	your	d-dream.”	Bethany's	brow	creased.	She	drummed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>her	fingers	against	her	folded	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	weren't,	but	you	were	mentioned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 know.	 You	 just	 were.”	 I	 was	 getting	 frustrated.	 Our	 conversation wasn't	going	the	way	I	imagined.	I	thought	she'd	be	happy	that	I	remembered	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph!	Ben	does	s-sound…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Familiar?”	I	hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	A	smile	appeared	for	a	moment	then	vanished	behind	a	scowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?	Why	a	boy's	n-name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rested	my	elbows	on	the	table	in	front	of	me	and	rubbed	my	forehead	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	heels	of	my	hands.	“I	don't	know,”	I	groaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 clinking	 of	 a	 spoon	 caused	 me	 to	 raise	 my	 head.	 Bethany	 filled	 her mouth	with	another	bite	of	oatmeal.	“Better	eat,	b-before	it	gets	too	c-cold,”	she sputtered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	finished	our	breakfast	in	silence,	lost	in	our	thoughts.	Our	spoons	clinked</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	scraped	the	dishes;	the	sounds	echoed	around	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Must	have	been	while	we	slept.”	Bethany	dropped	her	spoon	into	her	empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">bowl	and	pushed	it	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Her	voice	surprised	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	J	brought	this	in.”	She	rapped	her	knuckles	on	the	table.	“You	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">he'll	 be	 b-back?	 W-what	 about	 the	 needles?”	 Bethany's	 icy	 blue	 gaze</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentrated	on	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	and	shook	my	head.	I'd	also	wondered	about	our	injections	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">waking	in	new	surroundings.	It	had	only	been	a	couple	of	days.	And	while	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drug	that	kept	us	in	a	hypnotic	state	was	not	missed,	I	worried	about	the	vaccine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	had	never	mentioned	what	the	vaccine	protected	us	from	or	whether	it	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 made	 a	 mental	 note	 to	 ask	 him	 the	 next	 time	 he	 came	 around,	 and	 I	 hoped	 it would	be	soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	dressed	for	the	day	in	the	clothing	J	had	brought	the	night	before.	I	drew</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	familiar,	green	dress	toward	my	nose	and	sniffed	the	fabric.	I	closed	my	eyes and	 rubbed	 the	 soft	 material	 against	 my	 cheek.	 As	 the	 only	 piece	 of	 clothing, besides	my	nightclothes,	I	was	glad	it	was	clean.	We	could	not	know	how	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">we'd	be	wearing	the	same	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 my	 back	 to	 Bethany,	 who	 was	 already	 half	 naked	 and	 pulling	 her blue	 dress	 over	 her	 head.	 I	 pulled	 my	 nightgown	 off	 and	 replaced	 it	 with	 my green	frock.	It	was	soft	and	cool	against	my	skin	as	I	pulled	it	down.	My	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipped	a	little;	the	memory	of	my	drawing	came	to	mind.	I	would	no	longer	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	rubbing	underneath	and	poking	at	my	skin.	The	thought	made	me	a	little	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>But	as	impossible	as	it	was	I	held	on	to	the	hope	it	would	somehow	be	found. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	slid	both	of	my	hands	into	the	deep	pockets	and	wiggled	the	fingers	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	 hand.	 Something	 caught	 between	 my	 middle	 and	 ring	 finger.	 I	 wiggled them	again;	the	object	dislodged	and	fell.	It	burrowed	itself	deep	into	the	corner of	 my	 pocket.	 My	 fingers	 searched,	 finally	 finding	 the	 smooth	 and	 round	 bit.	 I pulled	it	out	and	found	it	was	a	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 small	 object	 did	 not	 match	 the	 buttons	 on	 my	 dress	 or	 Bethany's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	roughly	the	same	size,	the	button	I	held	in	my	palm	was	dark	brown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rubbed	 it	 between	 my	 finger	 and	 thumb	 before	 dropping	 it	 back	 into	 my pocket.	For	the	time	being,	it	would	remain	hidden	from	Bethany.	Once	again	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	ask	J.	The	list	of	questions	for	him	was	growing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	empty	room.	“You	didn't	find	anything	else?”	A	part	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	was	hopeful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“I	just	thought	maybe	something	to	pass	the	time.”	I	sat	back	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 chair,	 placed	 the	 dishes	 under	 their	 covers,	 and	 pushed	 them	 closer	 to	 the edge	of	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	sat	across	from	me	and	folded	her	arms.	“Unfortunately,	what	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	is	what	w-we	got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 are	 your	 eyes?”	 I	 jutted	 my	 chin	 toward	 her;	 she	 wasn't	 wearing	 her sunglasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.	It's	not	that	b-bright	in	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	up	and	pulled	the	sunglasses	from	my	face.	My	eyelids	fluttered; </p>
<p class="calibre1">tears	spilled	down	my	cheeks.	A	few	seconds	later,	they	settled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better?”	Bethany	questioned;	her	eyebrows	rose	partway	to	her	hairline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Yes,	I	don't	think	we're	going	to	need	these	anymore.”	I	poked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dark	glasses	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	we	w-will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tilted	my	head	to	the	side.	“When?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	rolled	her	eyes.	“When	we	g-get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 small,	 dirty	 window	 drew	 my	 attention.	 Bethany's	 optimistic	 words</p>
<p class="calibre1">contradicted	 my	 thoughts.  <i class="calibre3">If	 we	 get	 out	 of	 here,	 it	 won't	 be	 anytime	 soon. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	told	me	we'd	be	finding	the	way	out	on	our	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany's	voice	startled	me.	My	heart	thumped	beneath	my	golden	necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 don't	 you	 t-tell	 me	 all	 about	 that	 crazy	 dream	 of	 yours.	 And	 don't leave	anything	out,	especially	the	part	about	my	n-name.”	Bethany	winked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	at	my	sister	and	nodded.	I	would	tell	her	my	dream,	every	detail,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>one.	 My	 promise	 to	 our	 parents	 would	 remain	 a	 secret.	 Bethany	 didn't	 need	 to know;	it	already	bothered	her	that	I	remembered	more	than	she	did.	There	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	point	in	making	it	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gold	heart	pressed	into	my	palm	through	the	fabric	of	my	dress.	Besides, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	wasn't	the	secret	that	was	important.	The	dream	had	revealed	much	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.	My	sister	finally	had	a	name	of	her	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><b class="calibre4">Seventeen	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Jasper,	Cecil,	and	the	Cabinet</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tingles	 travelled	 down	 my	 forearm	 and	 exited	 my	 fingertips	 like	 pulses	 of electricity.	My	right	arm	had	fallen	asleep	like	the	rest	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 blinked	 my	 eyes	 open	 only	 to	 close	 them	 against	 the	 brightness	 that assailed	 them.	 I	 eased	 them	 open	 to	 tiny	 slits	 and	 allowed	 the	 light	 to	 filter through	 my	 lashes.	 After	 a	 moment	 my	 eyes	 settled,	 and	 the	 light	 no	 longer stung. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sweat	had	glued	my	cheek	to	the	table,	and	I	peeled	it	free.	A	string	of	spit</p>
<p class="calibre1">extended	from	my	chin	to	a	small	puddle	of	drool.	I	wiped	it	away	with	the	heel</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 hand.	 My	 stiffened	 neck	 muscles	 loosened	 as	 I	 rolled	 my	 head	 and stretched	my	arms	above	me.	A	wide	yawn	took	over	my	face;	my	eyes	watered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pushed	my	chair	back	from	the	table;	the	feet	squeaked.	But	Bethany,	who	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprawled	on	her	mat,	did	not	stir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	faint	creak	of	the	door	caught	my	attention,	and	I	jumped	from	my	chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	spun	around.	J	trudged	into	the	room,	his	breathing	an	audible	wheeze.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	 sunglasses	 and	 a	 white	 mask	 covered	 his	 face.	 His	 slow	 movements	 were enough	to	show	that	he	was	not	well.	He	dropped	the	cloth	bag	that	he	carried</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	walked	further	into	the	room.	The	tray	he	held	rattled	with	his	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit!”	I	pointed	to	the	chair	where	I	had	been	seated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shook	 his	 head.	 “I	 do	 not	 want	 to	 get	 too	 close;	 I	 am	 infected.	 If	 the immunization	failed…”	He	set	the	tray	of	food	on	the	cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	I	begged,	cutting	him	off	mid-sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	wheezed	a	sigh	and	plodded	toward	the	table.	I	moved	around	to	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	as	he	pulled	the	chair	further	back	before	sitting	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	so	many	questions,	and	I	need	to	know	the	answers.”	I	pleaded	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	eyes	and	held	his	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	nodded.	The	action	was	like	a	pistol	at	a	starting	line	and	questions	spilled</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	my	mouth.	“Why	are	you	infected?	How	are	you	sick	so	fast?	Why	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	not	vaccinated?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	enjoy	your	breakfast?”	J	responded	with	a	question	of	his	own	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">avoided	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Why	are	you	sick?”	I	was	not	going	to	give	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 virus	 is	 spread	 through	 close	 contact	 and…”	 A	 brief	 coughing	 fit	 cut short	 J's	 explanation.	 “The	 first	 symptoms	 appear	 quickly,”	 he	 continued, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“within	a	day	or	two	after	infection.	However,	the	progression	of	the	illness	itself is	slow.	In	the	beginning,	I	received	vaccines	for	each	new	mutation,	but	then	it was	stopped.”	He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things	changed.	I	should	go.”	J	began	to	rise	from	his	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can't!	 I	 have	 questions,	 I	 deserve	 answers.”	 My	 hand	 slammed	 down on	 the	 table.	 J	 sat	 straight	 in	 his	 seat.	 My	 action	 had	 surprised	 not	 only	 J	 but myself	 as	 well.	 My	 pulse	 raced.	 I	 turned	 and	 glanced	 at	 Bethany;	 still	 sound asleep	on	her	mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do,”	J	coughed.	“But	I	cannot…”	He	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?”	I	leaned	forward	and	rested	my	arms	on	the	table	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	cheeks	burned.	Bethany	rolled	over	and	groaned.	“Why	I	repeated;	my	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">quieted,	but	I	was	on	the	verge	of	losing	control	of	my	emotions	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">J	shook	his	head.	“We	are	not	safe.	I	cannot	risk	HIM	finding	out	you	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	you	should.	It	is	far	too	dangerous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 back	 in	 my	 chair	 and	 folded	 my	 arms;	 my	 jaw	 was	 tight.	 J	 rose	 and moved	to	the	cart.	He	gathered	the	dishes	from	our	last	meal	and	placed	them	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tray.	They	rattled	in	his	trembling	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	the	button	come	from,	the	one	in	the	pocket	of	my	dress?	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	is	your	real	name?”	I	whispered,	hoping	he	would	at	least	grant	me	answers</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	less	important	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	button	was	found	in	the	pocket	of	your	pyjamas	on	the	night	you	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	back,	and	my	full	name	is	Jasper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 squinted.	 There	 was	 that	 word	 again,	 'back'.	 I	 had	 no	 memories	 of	 my arrival	 or	 anytime	 at	 C.E.C.I.L	 other	 than	 the	 last	 several	 weeks.	 “Who	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">'HIM'?”	I	tried	again	to	glean	a	little	more	information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper	 shook	 his	 head	 and	 turned	 toward	 the	 door.	 “I	 will	 see	 you	 later, April.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 struggled	 as	 he	 carried	 the	 full	 tray	 with	 one	 hand	 and	 pulled	 the	 door open	 with	 the	 other.	 My	 exasperation	 kept	 me	 glued	 to	 the	 chair.	 “Who	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">'HIM'?”	I	yelled	as	he	walked	out	and	closed	the	door	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-what's	happened?”	Bethany's	sleep	filled	voice	came	from	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	sorry	I	woke	you.	Go	back	to	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	think	so.	It	m-must	be	the	middle	of	the	day.	What's	th-that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	look	at	Bethany	and	followed	her	outstretched	arm	to	her	pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">finger.	It	pointed	past	me	and	toward	the	door.	I	turned	back	and	saw	the	bag.	“I don't	know.	Jasper	brought	it	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“J-Jasper?”	 Bethany	 tilted	 her	 head	 to	 the	 side	 as	 her	 eyebrows	 squished together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	J's	real	name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 was	 here?”	 Bethany	 jumped	 up	 from	 her	 mat	 and	 hurried	 toward	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	 She	 snatched	 the	 blue	 cloth	 bag	 up	 from	 the	 floor	 and	 joined	 me	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>table.	 She	 sat	 down	 and	 set	 the	 unopened	 bag	 in	 front	 of	 her.	 “Why	 didn't	 you wake	me?	What	did	he	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	sound	asleep.”	I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	did	he	s-say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	h-had	questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 I	 did.”	 I	 pressed	 my	 lips	 together.	 My	 arms	 were	 still	 folded	 as	 I	 sat straight	in	my	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 what	 did	 he	 s-say?”	 Bethany's	 icy	 blue	 eyes	 looked	 as	 though	 they would	fall	from	their	sockets	if	she	opened	them	any	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 unfolded	 my	 arms,	 and	 my	 shoulders	 dropped.	 “He	 wouldn't	 tell	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything.”	 I	 slid	 my	 hand	 into	 the	 pocket	 of	 my	 dress,	 found	 the	 button,	 and rubbed	 it	 between	 my	 thumb	 and	 index	 finger.	 The	 fleeting	 memory	 of	 having done	that	long	ago	flickered	in	my	mind.	“Let's	eat	and	then	we'll	see	what's	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	bag.”	I	forced	a	smile.	I	did	not	want	to	discuss	my	conversation,	or	the	lack of,	with	J	any	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 grinned	 and	 dumped	 the	 bag.	 Several	 books	 clunked	 onto	 the	 table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 the	 last	 ones	 we'd	 received	 at	 C.E.C.I.L.,	 and	 Bethany's	 face	 lit	 up when	she	spied	the	one	she'd	been	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	grabbed	the	book	from	the	pile	and	headed	over	to	her	mat.	She	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 on	 her	 stomach,	 bent	 her	 legs	 up	 behind	 her	 and	 crossed	 them	 at	 the ankles.	She	flipped	the	book	open	to	the	first	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 starting	 over?”	 I	 said	 from	 my	 spot	 at	 the	 table.	 I'd	 moved	 back	 to the	other	chair,	preferring	the	view	of	the	window	over	the	hidden	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 sighed	 and	 looked	 up	 at	 me.	 “It's	 a	 short	 book,	 and	 we	 didn't	 get very	 m-many	 to	 pass	 the	 time.	 I'm	 starting	 over.”	 She	 turned	 back	 to	 the	 book and	immersed	herself	in	 <i class="calibre3">Charlotte's	Web. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded;	Bethany	had	a	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	largest	book	in	the	small	pile	caught	my	attention.	I	opened	it	to	the	title</p>
<p class="calibre1">page	 and	 began	 reading.	 No	 word	 would	 go	 unread.	 As	 Jasper	 had	 fallen	 ill,	 I feared	the	length	of	our	imprisonment	would	remain	undetermined.  <i class="calibre3">If	he	died…</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sudden	 thought	 came	 to	 my	 mind,	 and	 I	 pushed	 it	 away.	 I	 didn't	 want	 to think	about	what	would	happen	to	us	if	something	happened	to	him.	I	returned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	book	and	distracted	myself	with	the	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	 look	 at	 you,	 aren't	 you	 two	 a	 sight	 for	 sore	 eyes?	 Your	 noses	 buried	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>your	books	like	they	were	at	C.E.C.I.L.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	smooth	voice	startled	me,	and	I	whirled	toward	the	door.	He	stood	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway,	 dressed	 in	 a	 light	 blue	 dress	 shirt;	 the	 sleeves	 rolled	 to	 the	 elbows	 in perfect	symmetry.	A	dull	sunbeam	highlighted	a	white	piece	of	lint	that	clung	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	black	pants.	His	white	hair	shone	as	another	sunbeam	touched	his	head.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">scent	 of	 his	 cologne	 wafted	 through	 the	 air.	 In	 an	 instant,	 I	 knew	 who	 “HIM” </p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	and	I	turned	back	toward	my	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	thoughts	raced	as	I	pretended	to	be	as	unemotional	as	I	had	been	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 I	 saw	 him.	 I	 glanced	 over	 at	 Bethany	 before	 resuming	 my	 reading.	 She fixed	her	eyes	on	her	book	as	though	she	remembered	her	previous	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	come	now!	There's	no	need	to	pretend	anymore.	I	know	you	are	aware.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 sickening	 sweetness	 to	 his	 voice	 with	 a	 hint	 of	 menacing</p>
<p class="calibre1">undertones.	My	skin	prickled	as	a	nervous	shiver	travelled	up	my	body	to	the	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 head.	 I	 continued	 to	 focus	 my	 attention	 on	 the	 blurred	 words	 in	 front	 of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want?”	Bethany's	voice	broke	the	eerie	silence	that	fell	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room.	My	stomach	knotted;	my	body	became	more	rigid	as	I	turned	to	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	my	sister.	My	eyes	begged	her,	but	she	stared	past	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	B2,	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 head	 whipped	 back	 to	 look	 at	 Cecil.	 No	 matter	 how	 hard	 he	 tried,	 he couldn't	hide	his	threatening	tone	even	with	the	fake	smile	he	had	pasted	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face.	He	stared	over	at	Bethany;	his	creepy	grin	exhibited	contempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	followed	their	conversation	and	turned	back	toward	my	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bethany,”	she	said.	Her	grin	equalled	Cecil's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gasped	at	her	tone;	she	was	braver	than	I	thought	she	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	right	–	Bethany.”	He	turned	his	cold	gaze	to	me.	“And	you	are…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April.”	Despite	my	attempt	at	bravery,	I	couldn't	keep	the	tremor	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice,	and	I	was	sure	my	heartbeat	was	visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	girls…”	Cecil	pulled	out	the	chair	across	from	me	and	angled	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 that	 Bethany	 was	 not	 behind	 him.	 He	 brushed	 away	 the	 piece	 of	 lint	 I'd spotted	earlier	and	leaned	forward,	resting	his	elbows	on	his	knees.	He	clasped</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hands	together	in	front	of	him	and	twiddled	his	thumbs.	He	sighed.	“I	had	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 plans,	 so	 many	 plans	 for	 us.	 But	 that's	 all	 gone	 now.”	 He	 dropped	 his voice,	 and	 I	 wasn't	 sure	 if	 he	 was	 speaking	 to	 us	 or	 to	 himself.	 “You	 were	 my hope	for	the	new	world,	so	smart,	so	pretty	–	so	talented,	the	whole	package.	But now…”	 He	 sat	 back	 in	 his	 chair	 and	 raised	 his	 hands.	 “It's	 all	 gone,	 ruined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything.”	 He	 snapped	 his	 fingers,	 and	 I	 jumped;	 the	 sound	 echoed	 in	 the somewhat	empty	room.	“Poof!	Just	like	that	–	gone.	And	do	you	know	who	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	 thank	 for	 that?”	 His	 wild	 eyes	 darted	 between	 Bethany	 and	 me.	 “Well,	 do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>you?”	He	barked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	and	I	shook	our	heads.	Our	earlier	bravery	stifled	as	the	crazed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">angered	look	in	Cecil's	eyes	kept	us	from	saying	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	took	a	deep	breath	and	closed	his	eyes.	“Well,	you	can	thank	Jasper	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,”	he	said	emotionless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	jaw	dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 I	 w-will.”	 Bethany	 blurted.	 She'd	 found	 her	 courage	 again,	 and	 her bold	voice	interrupted	the	uncomfortable	silence	that	had	fallen	over	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glared	at	her,	willing	her	not	to	say	anything	more.	I	returned	my	attention</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Cecil	 as	 the	 sudden	 squeaking	 of	 his	 chair	 alerted	 me	 of	 his	 movement.	 He leaned	forward	again	in	a	casual	manner.	“Ha,”	he	chuckled,	“I'm	sure	you	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But…”	 Cecil	 rose	 from	 his	 chair,	 “just	 remember	 that	 his	 actions	 will	 be	 his downfall	–	and	yours.”	He	walked	toward	the	door	and	pulled	it	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 you	 mean?”	 I	 said,	 finding	 my	 voice	 despite	 the	 wild	 beating	 of my	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	that,	April,	is	a	story	for	another	day.”	Cecil	pulled	open	the	door	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped	out.	The	sound	of	a	lock	clicking	shut	on	the	other	side,	echoed	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	a	hand	over	the	back	of	my	neck	and	exhaled	a	shaky	breath.  <i class="calibre3">What	did</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">he	mean? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ass!”	Bethany's	voice	interrupted	the	beginning	of	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bethany!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	She	rolled	over	onto	her	side	and	propped	her	head	up	in	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just…oh	never	mind.”	I	rubbed	my	hands	over	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	he	is.	That	and	a	whole	lot	m-more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	down	at	Bethany	and	chuckled.	“Where	did	all	that	come	from?”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">waved	my	hand	toward	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	creased	her	brow.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	that	bravery	and	name	calling,	and…	whatever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	shrugged.	“I	don't	know,	it	s-seemed	sort	of…natural.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	you're	starting	to	remember	your	personality,”	I	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	–	I	hope	s-so,	this	not	remembering	stuff	is…crap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on.”	I	jumped	up	from	my	chair,	grabbed	Bethany's	arm,	and	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	up	from	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	d-doing?”	she	said	as	she	followed	me	toward	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plan	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	going	to	find	out	what's	in	that	cabinet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	in	front	of	the	wardrobe	and	stared	up	at	the	lock.	Even	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>rust,	the	old,	metal	bars	were	solid.	Bethany	had	proved	that	when	she'd	used	it as	a	foothold.	There	was	no	way	we	would	be	able	to	break	it	off,	but	I	hoped</p>
<p class="calibre1">somehow	we	could	pry	the	doors	open	enough	to	see	what	was	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grabbed	the	two	small	wooden	knobs	and	pulled.	The	lock	rattled,	but	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doors	remained	sealed.	My	hands	ran	down	from	the	handles	along	the	seam;	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingertips	 tugged	 as	 they	 searched	 for	 a	 hold.	 It	 wasn't	 until	 they	 reached	 the bottom	of	the	doors	that	a	small	hole	caught	my	attention.	I	tried	to	wedge	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">finger	inside,	but	the	indentation	was	too	small. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	there	anything	else	in	that	bag	besides	books?”	I	said	as	I	straightened</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	and	turned	toward	Bethany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“I	don't	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed;	her	words	erased	any	idea	I	had	of	prying	open	the	doors.	I	leaned</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 against	 the	 cabinet	 and	 eased	 my	 way	 down	 until	 I	 sat	 in	 front	 of	 it;	 a	 few moments	later	my	sister	joined	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	you	doing?”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thinking.”	 My	 eyes	 focused	 on	 the	 almost	 invisible	 door	 at	 the	 far	 end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	 I	 not	 seen	 it	 open,	 I	 would	 never	 have	 known	 it	 was	 there.	 Horizontal boards	 encircled	 the	 room	 and	 covered	 the	 entrance.	 With	 no	 knobs	 or	 latches, the	door	disappeared	into	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rested	my	head	against	the	cabinet	and	closed	my	eyes.	I	was	determined	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	out	what	was	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	still	thinking?”	Bethany	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	to	stick	in	that	little	hole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	shuffled	beside	me.	I	considered	opening	my	eyes	for	a	moment	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 footsteps	 moved	 away,	 but	 my	 mind	 drifted	 back	 to	 Jasper	 and	 Cecil.  <i class="calibre3">How</i> <i class="calibre3">long	 had	 Cecil	 been	 here?	 Had	 he	 been	 here	 the	 whole	 time?	 What	 were	 their</i> <i class="calibre3">plans? </i>	 More	 questions	 rolled	 through	 my	 head;	 I	 could	 not	 make	 any assumptions.	No	matter	what	their	intentions,	my	instincts	told	me	that	Bethany</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	were	on	our	own.	We	had	to	come	up	with	a	plan	if	we	wanted	to	get	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	this?”	A	short	wooden	pencil	lay	in	the	centre	of	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 did	 you	 find	 that?”	 I	 sat	 forward,	 snatched	 up	 the	 pencil,	 and scooted	around	to	face	the	wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	a	pocket	inside	the	bag.”	Bethany	pointed	over	her	shoulder	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	direction	of	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cross	your	fingers!”	I	said	as	I	sat	in	front	of	the	cabinet.	I	stuck	the	pencil into	the	hole	and,	using	it	as	a	lever,	tried	to	pry	open	the	bottom	corner	of	the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>“Is	it	going	to	work?”	Bethany	said	as	she	knelt	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pushed	 down	 a	 little	 harder.	 The	 wood	 gave	 into	 the	 pressure,	 and	 the pencil	snapped.	“CRAP!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	my	eyes.	She	was	one	to	talk.	“The	pencil	broke.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	now	you	have	two	p-pieces.	Just	stick	one	end	back	in	the	hole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 held	 up	 half	 of	 the	 pencil	 and	 pointed	 to	 the	 cabinet.	 “The	 other	 half	 is stuck	inside	the	hole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	crap!”	Bethany	mimicked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	groaned	and	leaned	against	the	closet	with	my	legs	stretched	out	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	My	head	tapped	against	the	doors,	and	I	closed	my	eyes.	My	fists	balled	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 sides.	 I	 inhaled	 through	 my	 nose	 and	 let	 the	 air	 escape	 between	 my	 pursed lips.	I	unclenched	my	hands	and	drummed	my	fingers	on	the	rough	floorboards; </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	nail	head	caught	my	fingernail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	an	idea.”	I	jumped	to	my	feet	and	headed	toward	the	nearest	wall	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	memory	of	pacing	out	the	room	came	to	mind.	“There's	a	nail	that	sticks	out; </p>
<p class="calibre1">help	me	find	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	walls	were	rough	and	full	of	nails,	most	sunk	deep	inside	the	boards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Watch	out	for	splinters,”	I	warned	Bethany	as	she	ran	her	fingers	over	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cracks	and	knotholes	were	everywhere.	The	holes	were	rather	disturbing	as	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">contained	 the	 bodies	 of	 dead	 insects.	 I	 jumped	 back	 from	 one	 particular knothole.	 A	 spider	 crawled	 out	 as	 I	 peered	 into	 it.	 I	 was	 thankful	 it	 wasn't	 big, but	 it	 was	 ugly	 just	 the	 same.	 The	 only	 spider	 I	 ever	 liked	 was	 from	 the	 book Bethany	happened	to	be	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	you	could	help	us,”	I	whispered	under	my	breath.	The	spider	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	and	disappeared	back	inside	its	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	continued	making	my	way	around	the	room.	My	eyes	and	fingers	searched</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wall	with	diligence.	Finally,	they	bumped	into	the	nail	I'd	remembered,	and	I called	 Bethany	 over	 to	 help	 me	 pull	 it	 out.	 Unfortunately,	 though	 it	 stuck	 out quite	far,	it	would	not	budge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 isn't	 going	 to	 work.	 It's	 in	 there	 too	 tight,	 and	 my	 fingers	 keep slipping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mine	too.”	Bethany	rubbed	her	fingertips	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 walked	 back	 over	 toward	 the	 wardrobe.	 I	 placed	 my	 hands	 on	 my	 hips and	stared	up	at	the	lock;	narrowing	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I	can	try	at	the	top.”	I	looked	down	in	time	to	see	Bethany	walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">away.	“What	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 not	 lifting	 you.	 You	 can	 s-stand	 on	 the	 t-table	 if	 you	 want	 to	 get	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	chuckled	and	helped	Bethany	with	the	table.	If	there	was	one	thing	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">relearning	 about	 my	 sister,	 it	 was	 her	 bold	 nature.	 She	 had	 a	 knack	 for	 being direct	and	saying	what	was	on	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 pulled	 the	 table	 up	 to	 the	 cabinet,	 and	 I	 climbed	 on	 top.	 I	 was	 able	 to reach	the	lock	and	like	before,	slid	my	fingers	down	along	where	the	doors	met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	every	inch	my	fingers	inspected,	the	more	my	stomach	knotted.	The	doors</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 solid	 with	 no	 holes	 or	 dents	 for	 my	 fingers	 to	 grab	 hold.	 I	 stopped searching	when	I	reached	the	knobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	we	had	the	key	or	a	piece	of	wire	or	something.”	I	rose	to	my	feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	stared	at	the	padlock.	Once	again	I	heard	Bethany's	footsteps,	but	I	remained focused	on	the	lock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	see	if	this	works.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	in	the	palm	of	Bethany's	outstretched	hand	was	a	key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	get	this?”	I	plucked	the	small,	black	and	rust	coloured	object</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up	there.”	She	pointed	to	the	top	of	the	cabinet.	“I	f-found	it	when	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbing	down	and	put	it	in	my	pocket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 didn't	 you	 tell	 me?”	 I	 stared	 at	 the	 key	 I	 was	 holding	 between	 my fingers	in	disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 f-forgot.	 My	 head	 is	 still	 a	 little	 f-fuzzy	 sometimes.”	 She	 shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,	you	kept	talking	about	p-prying	the	cabinet	open,	not	unlocking	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	there	was	no	point	in	arguing.	I	faced	the	cabinet,	put	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">key	in	the	lock	and	turned	it.	The	padlock	fell	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a><b class="calibre4">Eighteen	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The	Ghosts	Inside</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	climbed	down	off	the	old	table,	and	with	Bethany's	help,	we	slid	it	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 stood	 in	 front	 of	 the	 cabinet,	 its	 presence	 larger	 and	 more	 foreboding than	before.	My	stomach	knotted,	and	I	clenched	my	fists.	The	skin	on	my	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">tightened	 as	 the	 blood	 drained	 from	 my	 face.	 Dread	 replaced	 any	 idea	 I	 had about	opening	the	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	the	m-matter?”	Bethany's	warm	hand	touched	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.”	I	hesitated	for	a	moment	then	reached	for	the	handles	and	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	doors	open.	In	an	instant,	the	room	filled	with	the	musty	smell	of	old	things	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">secrets,	kept	locked	away	from	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 stood	 there	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 contents,	 both	 of	 us	 paralyzed.	 Shirts	 and pants,	night-clothes,	and	dresses	filled	the	clothing	bar.	Stacked	in	the	bottom	of the	 cabinet	 were	 shoeboxes.	 I	 took	 a	 hesitant	 step	 forward	 and	 reached	 inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 fingers	 brushed	 the	 stained	 and	 faded	 pieces	 of	 clothing	 that	 varied	 in	 size and	 colour.	 The	 dresses	 were	 similar	 to	 the	 ones	 Bethany	 and	 I	 were	 wearing, and	I	recognized	them	immediately	as	C.E.C.I.L	attire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whose	are	th-those?”	Bethany's	voice	questioned	from	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	would	I	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	rhetorical.	I	d-didn't	think	you'd	know,”	Bethany	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knew	that.”	I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	a	pale	blue	dress	from	the	hanger.	Its	worn	fabric	was	soft	under	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingertips.	 The	 dress	 was	 small,	 too	 small	 for	 me,	 but	 about	 the	 right	 size	 for Bethany.	I	turned	the	dress	over	in	my	hands	and	searched	the	inside	at	the	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	collar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	looking	for?”	Bethany's	voice	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	ID	number	like	what	we	have	on	our	dresses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	there	was,	it's	been	crossed	out.”	I	pointed	to	the	faded	black	line	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside	of	the	dress'	collar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	at	least	w-we	have	some	extra	clothing.	That	one	l-looks	like	it'll	fit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	down	at	the	dress	in	my	hands,	shook	my	head	and	sighed.	“You're</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	wearing	this	dress	or	any	other	clothing	from	this	cabinet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	squeezed	her	eyes	to	tiny	slits	and	folded	her	arms.	“And	w-why	n-not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Why	not?	Because	they	smell	and	were	worn	by	some	unfortunate	person	–</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">that's	 why	 not. </i>	 My	 answer	 to	 Bethany's	 question	 rolled	 through	 my	 head	 as	 I stared	at	the	piece	of	clothing	in	my	hands.	It	wasn't	like	our	clothing;	it	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>same.	I	eyed	some	of	the	other	pieces	hanging	in	the	cabinet.	They	were	all	the same,	only	different	colours,	some	more	worn	and	stained	than	others.	The	pants</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	shirts	were	also	alike,	all	some	sort	of	uniform.	I	rubbed	my	hand	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 of	 my	 neck;	 my	 fingers	 plucked	 at	 the	 collar.	 Visions	 of	 my	 ID	 number printed	 on	 the	 cloth	 came	 to	 mind.  <i class="calibre3">What	 had	 happened	 to	 the	 residents	 of</i> <i class="calibre3">C.E.C.I.L	who	had	worn	these	pieces	of	clothing? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	tell	Bethany	my	suspicions	but	kept	my	thoughts	to	myself.	As	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	out,	Bethany	spotted	something	undesirable	about	the	dress,	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ew,	w-what's	that?”	She	pointed	to	the	dress	hanging	from	my	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	searched	the	wad	of	fabric	for	whatever	it	was	she'd	seen.	Finally,	my	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">spotted	 a	 reddish-brown	 mark	 that	 covered	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 dress.	 The	 old blood	stain	caused	my	stomach	to	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	a	stain.”	I	threw	the	piece	of	clothing	over	the	bar.	“Let's	see	what's	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	Maybe	there's	something	we	can	use.	And	I	don't	mean	any	of	the	clothes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	toward	the	wardrobe	and	started	pulling	out	the	boxes	and	setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	th-those	pyja….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	closed	my	eyes	and	steadied	my	voice.	“No!”	Her	loud	sigh	alerted	me	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	frustration,	and	I	could	sense	her	glare	at	the	back	of	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THOSE	PYJAMAS	ARE	YOURS,”	she	yelled.	She	had	my	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 backed	 away	 from	 the	 cabinet	 and	 stood	 beside	 her.	 Bethany	 pointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight	 ahead,	 and	 I	 spotted	 what	 she	 was	 looking	 at	 right	 away.	 Stuffed between	some	clothing	was	a	faded	pair	of	orange	pyjamas	with	yellow	flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gasped.	 “We	 can't	 be	 sure	 they're	 mine.	 Besides,	 how	 can	 you	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	them?”	I	said	turning	away	from	the	cabinet	and	staring	at	my	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged	and	 scrunched	her	forehead;	 her	right	hand	 scratched	the	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	head.	“I	don't	know.	S-sometimes	I	remember	things,	and	then	I	th-think</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	it's	a	dream.	Maybe	what	I	remember	isn't	real.	But	those	p-pyjamas…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 nodded,	 “I	 will	 never	 forget	 those.	 I	 think,”	 her	 eyes	 rolled	 up,	 “I	 think	 I hated	them.”	She	looked	back	at	me;	her	eyelids	fluttered	for	a	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hah!”	I	nodded.	“You	did	hate	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	and	shook	my	head.	“I	have	no	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	they	are	yours?”	She	raised	her	eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	to	the	cabinet	and	stepped	closer.	I	pulled	the	top	from	the	wire</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanger.	The	pants	were	folded	and	draped	over	the	lower	bar.	My	fingers	rubbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	soft	fabric. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	looking	for?”	Bethany	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 heard	 her	 question	 but	 didn't	 answer.	 My	 fingers	 searched	 the	 fabric	 as though	they	had	their	own	memories.	The	evidence	they	looked	for,	only	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 combed	 through	 my	 memories,	 searching	 for	 the	 one	 my	 fingers	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">recalled.	 I	 lifted	 the	 fabric	 closer	 to	 my	 eyes.	 They	 too	 remembered	 and	 began scanning	 the	 orange	 cloth	 dotted	 with	 yellow	 flowers.	 My	 eyes	 and	 fingers worked	together	to	find	the	proof	that	would	confirm	their	suspicion.	My	brain</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 still	 unsure	 of	 what	 that	 was.	 A	 small,	 uneven	 bump	 caught	 my	 fingers' </p>
<p class="calibre1">attention.	They	stopped	their	search	as	my	eyes	examined	the	fabric.	Under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">armpit	of	the	sleeve,	near	the	seam,	I	spotted	the	inconsistency	of	the	pattern.	I turned	the	top	inside	out	to	have	a	better	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	small	tear	had	been	sewn	quite	well	given	it	was	triangular	in	shape.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers	rubbed	over	the	scar	on	the	underside	of	the	pyjama	top.	The	vision	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">needle	and	thread	stitching	a	hole	came	to	mind.	I	stuck	my	finger	in	my	mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	image	of	the	needle	poking	my	finger	and	drawing	blood	also	came	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	skin	prickled	and	rose	into	tiny	bumps.	I'd	hoped	I	would	not	find	the	proof</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	they	were	mine.	I	returned	the	top	back	to	its	hanger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	yours,	aren't	they?”	Bethany	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	began	removing	the	small	boxes.	Seconds	later,	Bethany	joined</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	and	together	we	emptied	the	cabinet	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	what?”	Bethany	said,	wiping	her	hand	across	her	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	removed	twenty-nine	boxes.	Some	of	which	were	on	a	shelf	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	of	the	wardrobe.	Bethany	had	had	to	crawl	in	and	pass	them	out	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Open	them…	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	of	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	small	pile	of	boxes	surrounded	us.	Some	had	identifying	marks	written	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">pen	or	marker,	others	had	drawings,	and	a	few	had	nothing	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 picked	 up	 one	 of	 the	 cartons	 with	 an	 ID	 on	 it	 and	 held	 it	 in	 her hands,	she	squinted.	“This	looks	familiar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	the	box	and	the	identification.	It	had	no	meaning	to	me.	“What	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 remember…”	 she	 paused	 and	 scratched	 her	 head.	 “I	 did	 something	 like this,”	she	looked	back	up	from	the	box,	“before	I	came	to	your	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	thoughts	drifted	back	to	C.E.C.I.L.	The	memory	was	hazy,	but	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 vague	 feeling	 that	 I	 too,	 had	 had	 such	 a	 box.	 I	 put	 my	 hand	 into	 my	 pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 small,	 brown	 button	 nestled	 in	 the	 corner,	 and	 I	 rubbed	 it	 between	 my fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 you	 think	 these	 are	 the	 s-same?	 I	 mean	 not	 m-mine	 or	 yours,	 but	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>same	thing?	Bethany's	eyes	widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shrugged.	 “I	 don't	 know.	 I	 sort	 of	 remember	 a	 box,	 but	 I	 don't	 remember what	it	was	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	drew	on	mine	–	a	coloured	arc,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 raised	 my	 eyebrows.	 “A	 rainbow?”	 I	 took	 the	 box	 from	 Bethany's	 hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	let's	put	these	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	we	were	going	to	open	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will,	but	maybe	one	at	a	time.	We	don't	want	him	catching	us	with	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.”	I	waved	my	hand	around	at	the	shoeboxes	spread	out	on	the	floor	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	Cecil?”	Bethany	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 “Yes,	 him	 or	 even	 Jasper	 –	 just	 in	 case.”	 I	 stepped	 forward;	 my hand	 pressed	 against	 my	 aching	 lower	 back.	 I	 looked	 up	 at	 the	 bar	 weighed down	by	clothing.	Standing	on	tiptoe,	I	reached	up	in	the	centre	and	pushed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparel	to	one	side	and	then	the	other.	The	adjustment	exposed	the	shelf	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	and	I	wished	I'd	thought	of	that	earlier.	I	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hand	me	a	box,	Beth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	d-did	you	call	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	for	a	second.	“Sorry…Bethany.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I	 like	 that.”	 She	 smiled.	 “You	 can	 call	 me	 Beth.”	 She	 handed	 me	 a couple	of	the	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	as	I	set	them	down	on	the	shelf.	A	carving	on	the	back	wall	caught</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	attention,	and	I	moved	in	for	closer	examination.	I	traced	my	fingers	over	the rough	 indentations	 –	 C-2,	 “Someone's	 been	 in	 here?”	 I	 called	 out.	 My	 focus returned	to	the	alphanumeric	string	gouged	in	the	wood	–	0-1-6-0-9-2-7-L. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Beth's	muffled	voice	came	to	my	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There's	an	ID	carved	into	the	back	wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	does	it	s-say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	finger	traced	along	each	letter	and	number	as	I	called	them	out	to	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	remember	ever	meeting	anyone	else	at	C.E.C.I.L?”	I	called	as	I	stared</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 combination	 of	 letters	 and	 numbers.	 The	 smell	 of	 wood	 and	 old,	 musty clothing	filled	my	nose	as	I	waited	for	Beth's	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	remember.	D-did	you	meet	anyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 hand	 brushed	 over	 the	 carving	 again.	 Unfocused	 images	 and	 visions</p>
<p class="calibre1">flooded	my	brain.	Recent	memories	combined	with	dreams,	old	ones	mixed	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts.	 I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 and	 thought	 back	 to	 earlier	 memories	 of	 C.E.C.I.L. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	weren't	many,	but	a	few	had	begun	to	creep	back.	Occasional	encounters</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	walked	down	long,	white	corridors	flitted	through	my	mind.	“I	don't	know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>Another	indentation	below	the	ID	caught	my	attention,	and	I	crouched	lower in	 the	 closet.	 My	 fingers	 traced	 over	 the	 roughly	 carved	 letters;	 the	 engraving made	no	sense.	“What	do	you	think	that	says?	Is	it	another	ID?”	I	stepped	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cabinet	and	allowed	Beth	to	have	a	look.	A	few	moments	later	she	crawled</p>
<p class="calibre1">out;	her	nose	wrinkled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know.	It's	n-nothing	like	ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	moved	back	into	my	place	and	stared	at	the	group	of	letters	–	GOB42L8.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered	 the	 letters	 and	 numbers,	 hoping	 that	 they	 would	 somehow	 begin	 to make	sense.	My	skin	prickled	on	the	third	run-through	as	I	whispered	the	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	What	are	you	s-saying?”	Beth	called	from	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	moved	back	from	the	cabinet	and	stared	at	the	ID	and	the	carving	below.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 message.	 It	 was	 a	 warning.	 I	 turned	 and	 looked	 at	 Beth.	 “Go,	 before	 it's too	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a><b class="calibre4">Nineteen	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Peanut	Butter</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“April?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	s-sleeping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	half	smiled.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	didn't	we	didn't	open	up	any	b-boxes?”	Beth	yawned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	hand	out	in	front	of	me	and	turned	it,	its	outline	somewhat	visible</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	darkness.	A	small	groan	escaped	my	lips	as	I	pulled	my	legs	up	and	rested</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	feet	flat	on	the	pad.	The	altered	position	pressed	my	lower	back	into	the	mat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 eased	 the	 ache.	 The	 thin	 mattress	 offered	 little	 protection	 between	 the hardwood	floor	and	my	bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because.	Now	go	to	sleep.”	The	carved	letters	and	numbers	danced	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness	 in	 front	 of	 me,	 and	 I	 squeezed	 my	 eyelids	 shut.	 The	 warning	 etched inside	 the	 cabinet	 had	 confirmed	 my	 suspicions	 about	 the	 clothing.	 I	 hadn't wanted	to	deal	with	any	more	surprises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	open	one	t-tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe…if	you	stop	talking	and	go	to	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 was	 the	 last	 I	 heard	 from	 Beth.	 How	 I	 managed	 to	 fall	 asleep	 myself was	a	mystery,	and	when	I	woke	up,	the	room	had	begun	to	lighten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	and	stared	at	the	cabinet,	afraid	of	the	secrets	it	held,	but	curious	at the	same	time.	I	threw	on	my	clothing;	without	thought,	my	hand	dipped	into	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket.	The	button	rested	in	its	corner.	A	few	moments	later,	I	tiptoed	toward	the large	piece	of	furniture.	It	drew	me	with	some	invisible	force,	like	a	small	child to	the	promise	of	an	irresistible	treat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	hesitation,	my	hands	reached	for	the	handles	and	tugged.	The	doors</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained	 shut.	 I	 pulled	 again	 with	 a	 little	 more	 force.	 The	 lock	 rattled,	 and	 I remembered	we'd	locked	the	cabinet	back	up	the	day	before.	My	hands	fell	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	side;	I	was	both	relieved	and	disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gasped	and	spun	around.	Beth	stood	behind	me;	her	outstretched	hand	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	small	key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	snatched	the	key	from	Beth's	hand	and	put	it	in	my	pocket.	“Not	now.”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomped	back	to	my	mat	and	lay	down	on	my	sore	back.	I	counted	the	beams	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ceiling.	 Each	 one	 touched	 by	 the	 light	 that	 filtered	 in	 through	 the	 small window.	There	were	only	six,	but	I	knew	that	already.	I	had	counted	them	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	since	we'd	been	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany's	shadow	loomed	over	me.	She	looked	down	at	me	and	scowled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>“W-why	not?”	Beth	crossed	her	arms	and	glared	down	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed	 and	 sat	 up.  <i class="calibre3">Why	 not? </i>	 “Sit	 down,	 Beth.”	 I	 patted	 her	 mat.	 Small chunks	 of	 foam	 were	 missing,	 and	 it	 looked	 less	 comfortable	 than	 mine.	 Beth didn't	move.	“Please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 sighed	 and	 sat	 crossed	 legged	 in	 front	 of	 me;	 she	 kept	 her	 arms folded.	I	wasn't	sure	what	I	was	going	to	say	to	her,	but	I	was	certain	'because' </p>
<p class="calibre1">was	no	longer	a	suitable	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	deep	breath.	“We	can't	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	my	two	favourite	girls	this	morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hadn't	heard	him	come	in	and	jumped	at	the	sound	of	his	voice,	though	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">scent	hit	my	nose	at	about	the	same	time.	Bethany	startled	too	and	looked	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 to	 where	 Cecil	 stood.	 It	 took	 a	 moment	 before	 I	 rose	 and	 turned	 around	 to face	him.	Bethany	joined	me	at	my	side,	a	scowl	pasted	to	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where's	 Jasper?”	 Beth	 demanded	 before	 I	 could	 give	 her	 the	 'be-careful-what-you-say'	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph,”	Cecil	snorted.	“I	see	you	haven't	changed	your	attitude	much	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	time.”	He	ran	a	hand	through	his	white	hair.	The	sweat	stain	under	his	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	quite	visible	on	his	royal	blue	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	why	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 reached	 out	 and	 placed	 my	 hand	 on	 Beth's	 back,	 interrupting	 her	 mid-sentence.	“We're	concerned,”	I	said.	My	voice	was	even.	“He	didn't	look	well	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	time	we	saw	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil's	grey	eyes	fixed	on	my	face.	“Concerned?	How	dare	you?”	His	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 low	 and	 threatening	 as	 he	 sharpened	 his	 glare	 on	 me.	 I	 swallowed	 hard	 in response;	 my	 mouth	 suddenly	 dry.	 In	 the	 same	 instant,	 his	 gaze	 softened	 as	 he regained	 his	 composure.	 “He's	 feeling	 a	 little…unwell.”	 He	 shrugged	 as	 one corner	of	his	mouth	rose	in	a	smug	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	want	to	s-see	him,”	Beth	said	through	clenched	teeth.	I	pushed	my	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	her	lower	back	as	a	reminder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 sure	 you	 do.	 Anyway,”	 Cecil	 clapped	 his	 hands	 and	 rubbed	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">together.	“I	have	something	for	you.”	He	turned	on	his	heel	and	left	the	room.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	later	he	returned,	walking	in	backwards.	I	tried	to	look	around	him	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	something	along.	For	the	first	time,	the	door	laid	all	the	way	open	into	the room.	I	took	a	quiet	step	to	my	left.	I	focused	on	what	was	on	the	other	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	entrance,	but	all	I	could	see	was	a	darkened	hall.	I	shifted	my	attention	to	the open	door	and	the	doorknob	with	a	key	in	the	lock.  <i class="calibre3">Was	the	key	always	there? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	only	brought	you	one,”	he	wheezed	breathless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	raspy	voice	brought	my	attention	to	the	folded	piece	of	metal	he	pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	room	with	a	mattress	stuffed	in	the	middle.	Bethany	and	I	stood	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>table	 as	 he	 rolled	 it	 towards	 our	 mats	 and	 unfolded	 the	 cot.	 The	 worn	 mattress looked	inviting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	and	stepped	towards	us,	beads	of	sweat	dripped	down	the	sides	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face.	I	backed	up	as	he	approached	and	bumped	into	the	table	behind	me.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	 inches	 in	 front	 of	 me	 and	 glared	 down,	 a	 sneer	 fixed	 to	 his	 face.	 His breath	 was	 foul,	 and	 I	 could	 as	 much	 taste	 it	 as	 smell	 it.	 He	 reached	 up	 and brushed	a	lock	of	hair	from	my	cheek.	Goosebumps	rose	on	my	skin.	Had	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	anything	in	my	stomach	it	would	have	been	all	over	the	floor.	Instead,	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">bile	burned	at	the	back	of	my	throat.	I	swallowed	it	down	and	met	his	grey	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	not	going	to	allow	him	the	satisfaction	of	knowing	my	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	 let	 him	 know	 you're	 concerned.”	 He	 smiled;	 a	 small	 bit	 of	 some	 food had	 caught	 between	 two	 of	 his	 teeth.	 Before	 I	 could	 respond,	 a	 coughing	 fit racked	Cecil's	body.	Beth	and	I	watched,	and	it	wasn't	until	he'd	regained	control that	 my	 eyes	 left	 his	 crumpled	 form.	 My	 gaze	 drifted	 over	 to	 the	 wide-open door;	we'd	missed	our	opportunity	to	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have	 something	 else	 for	 you.”	 He	 cleared	 his	 throat	 and	 pulled	 a	 folded piece	of	cloth	from	the	pocket	of	his	beige	pants.	Then	he	dabbed	at	his	mouth	as he	turned	toward	the	door.	When	he	came	back,	he	carried	a	blue	cloth	bag,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	set	it	down	on	the	table.	“Your	breakfast.”	He	smirked	and	turned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	the	bag	as	the	clicking	of	the	door	closing	behind	him	echoed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	ears.	The	food	Jasper	had	brought	could	not	compare	with	what	we'd	enjoyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	C.E.C.I.L,	but	it	was	edible.	I	couldn't	imagine	what	he	had	planned	for	us.	I couldn't	help	feel	like	that	sack	was	a	bad	omen.  <i class="calibre3">What	is	happening? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	t-to	open	it?”	Beth's	voice	shook	me	from	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shrugged.	 I	 didn't	 want	 to	 open	 it.	 I	 didn't	 want	 to	 accept	 anything	 from him.	 My	 stomach,	 however,	 had	 its	 own	 agenda,	 and	 it	 grumbled	 with	 loud complaint.	I	exhaled	and	nodded.	“You	can,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 approached	 the	 table	 and	 untied	 the	 handles	 of	 the	 bag.	 She	 removed the	 few	 items	 from	 inside.	 The	 smell	 of	 overripe	 bananas	 permeated	 the	 room, and	my	stomach	growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where'd	he	get	those?”	I	wondered	out	loud	as	I	viewed	the	mostly	brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">bananas	in	Beth's	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shook	her	head	and	placed	them	on	the	table.	She	reached	into	the	sack</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 bag	 of	 bread.	 The	 bag	 was	 half	 full	 and	 contained	 an assortment	 of	 crusts	 and	 slices	 from	 different	 kinds.	 Finally,	 she	 pulled	 out	 a large	jar	of	peanut	butter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	heavy,	it	must	be	f-full,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	see.”	I	took	the	jar	from	her	outstretched	hand.	I	bounced	it	in	mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	weighed	it.	My	shaking	fingers	unscrewed	the	lid,	and	I	removed	it	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>jar.	Paper	covered	the	opening.	“It's	a	new	jar.”	I	tilted	it	toward	my	sister	so	she could	see	the	covering	that	sealed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-why	 would	 he	 give	 us	 an	 entire	 jar?	 Why	 not	 a	 s-sandwich?”	 Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">questioned.	Her	voice	and	narrowed	eyes	gave	away	the	distrust	in	what	she	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	with	good	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 looks	 like	 we'll	 be	 feeding	 ourselves	 for	 a	 while.”	 We'd	 been	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">accustomed	 to	 three	 prepared	 meals	 a	 day	 it	 never	 occurred	 to	 me	 that	 things would	 be	 much	 different.	 C.E.C.I.L	 met	 our	 needs	 despite	 the	 captivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherever	we	were,	we	were	on	our	own,	left	to	fend	for	ourselves.	Only	now	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	less	freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	the	jar	in	my	hands	and	read	the	label.	The	green	paper	stood	out	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 familiar.	 My	 mind	 searched	 through	 its	 storage	 of	 memories.	 A	 list	 of thoughts	and	happenings	had	grown	each	day.	A	small	fragment	of	one	memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	out	from	the	rest.	I	fixated	on	the	tiny	remnant.	Like	fingernails	trying	to extract	a	splinter,	I	dug	until	I	got	hold	of	the	foreign	object. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	concentrated	on	an	image	in	my	head.	My	thoughts	focused	and	sharpened</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	the	memory	pulled	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peanut	 butter	 had	 been	 a	 favourite	 food	 of	 mine	 until	 one	 summer.	 Our parents	 had	 gone	 away	 on	 a	 trip	 and	 left	 us	 in	 the	 care	 of	 a	 babysitter.	 If	 my memory	 was	 correct,	 peanut	 butter	 sandwiches	 were	 all	 she	 had	 fed	 us	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakfast,	lunch,	and	supper.	After	the	experience,	I	never	ate	one	again.	I	stared at	the	full	jar	in	my	hands;	my	stomach	rolled	at	the	memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	are	you	going	to	s-stare	at	that	all	day	or	are	we	going	to	eat?”	Beth's</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyebrows	rose,	and	she	looked	annoyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here.”	I	thrust	the	jar	toward	her.	“You	can	open	it.”	I	wasn't	quite	sure	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	stomach	would	handle	the	smell.	Beth	took	the	jar	from	my	hand	and	set	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	table.	“Is	there	anything	else	in	the	bag?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 reached	 her	 hand	 in	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 small,	 plastic	 knife.	 “Like this?”	She	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	stomach	growled	as	Bethany	peeled	the	paper	from	the	jar.	I	wasn't	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rumble	was	hunger-driven,	and	I	took	a	small	step	back.	The	fresh	aroma	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">peanuts	 wafted	 from	 the	 jar	 the	 moment	 she	 tore	 the	 paper	 free.	 Beth	 tilted	 it towards	me	before	lifting	it	to	her	nose.	She	took	a	long	inhale	from	the	jar	and closed	her	eyes.	For	a	second	I	thought	she'd	inhale	all	the	smell	from	the	peanut butter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 uttering	 another	 word,	 we	 sat	 down.	 I	 grabbed	 a	 banana	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">removed	 the	 dark	 brown	 peel.	 The	 fruit	 inside	 was	 soft,	 and	 I	 had	 to	 take	 care not	to	turn	it	into	mush	as	I	sliced	it	into	small	pieces.	When	I	finished,	I	handed Beth	 the	 knife,	 and	 she	 began	 to	 build	 peanut	 butter	 and	 banana	 sandwiches. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>Much	of	the	bread	was	stale	or	mouldy,	but	we	managed	to	find	four	slices	that were	good	enough	to	eat.	When	she	finished,	she	handed	one	of	the	sandwiches</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 me.	 I	 inspected	 the	 white	 and	 brown	 bread	 sandwich;	 the	 smell	 of	 peanut butter	and	banana	not	quite	as	strong	as	before.	My	stomach	growled	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm!”	 Beth's	 voice	 distracted	 me,	 and	 I	 glanced	 up	 at	 her.	 She	 held	 her food	 in	 her	 hands	 and	 licked	 her	 lips.	 She	 closed	 her	 eyes	 and	 bit	 into	 her creation.	She	savoured	the	mouthful	like	it	was	her	last	meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	my	attention	toward	my	food.	I	brought	the	sandwich	closer	to	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth,	hesitated,	closed	my	eyes,	and	took	a	bite.	It	wasn't	as	bad	as	I	thought	it would	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	ate	in	silence.	Each	bite	tasted	better	than	the	last.	I	chewed	every	sticky</p>
<p class="calibre1">piece	until	it	dissolved	in	my	mouth.	Although	there	was	plenty	of	peanut	butter, I	would	make	sure	we	weren't	as	liberal	with	it	the	next	time	we	ate.	My	instinct told	me	that	food	was	not	going	to	be	as	abundant	as	it	had	been.	There	was	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	 when,	 or	 if,	 Cecil	 would	 bring	 us	 more.	 We'd	 only	 been	 there	 for	 a	 few days,	and	while	Jasper	had	brought	food	for	every	meal,	we	couldn't	trust	Cecil</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	the	same.	If	Jasper	was	too	ill,	the	peanut	butter	might	be	the	last	food	we ever	get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	 b-breakfast…can	 we	 open	 up	 one	 of	 those	 boxes…p-please?”	 Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke	through	sticky	peanut	butter	bites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	forgotten	that	before	the	interruption	by	Cecil	I	was	going	to	explain	why</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn't	 think	 we	 should	 open	 any	 boxes.	 “Okay.”	 I	 changed	 my	 mind.	 Maybe there	 was	 something	 in	 one	 of	 those	 cartons,	 something	 that	 would	 help	 us	 to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The	Window</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurry	up!”	Bethany	tapped	her	foot	and	glared	at	me	with	impatient	eyes.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	told	her	we'd	open	up	a	box,	she'd	gulped	down	her	peanut	butter	sandwich	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast	I	was	afraid	she	was	going	to	choke.	I	looked	down	at	the	remaining	bit	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sandwich	 in	 my	 hand.	 There	 were	 only	 a	 few	 more	 bites	 left,	 and	 I	 wanted	 to savour	every	last	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why're	you	taking	s-so	long?”	Bethany	whined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 <i class="calibre3">was</i>	 taking	 long,	 stalling	 even.	 The	 thought	 of	 opening	 that	 cabinet	 again with	all	its	nasty	secrets	made	my	stomach	roll.  <i class="calibre3">And	what	if	he	catches	us?	How</i> <i class="calibre3">could	we	even	begin	to	explain? </i>	I	shook	at	the	thought.	I	didn't	want	to	imagine what	he	might	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	April,	before	he	comes	b-back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	swallowed	another	piece	and	looked	up	at	Beth.	Her	mouth	had	drawn	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	tight	line,	and	there	was	no	doubt	she	had	become	annoyed	with	me.	“Back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	do	you	mean	by	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	that	rumbling	noise	again.	I	think	it	was	a…”	She	closed	her	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her	brow	furrowed	in	concentration.	“A	truck!”	Bethany	smiled	as	the	lost	word</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	back	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	he	has	a	truck?	I	didn't	hear	anything.”	I	tilted	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	 because	 you	 were	 too	 b-busy	 thinking	 about	 chewing.”	 Bethany</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed	 to	 the	 chunk	 of	 sandwich	 still	 clutched	 between	 my	 thumb	 and	 index finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	popped	the	last	bite	into	my	mouth	and	headed	toward	the	wardrobe.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair	dragged	behind	me	as	I	pulled	it	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	opening	a	b-box,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	 me!”	 I	 ignored	 Beth	 and	 placed	 the	 chair	 beside	 the	 cabinet	 then returned	to	get	the	table.	I	grabbed	one	end	and	nodded	for	her	to	take	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	the	key	is	in	your	p-pocket,”	Bethany	reminded	me	as	we	placed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	table	in	front	of	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	need	it.”	I	grabbed	the	chair	and	lifted	it	up	onto	the	table,	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed	on	top.	“Hold	it	steady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	you	doing?”	Beth	grabbed	a	chair	leg	in	each	hand	and	steadied	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	going	to	look	out	the	window.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-why?”	Her	voice	rose	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	you	heard	a	rumbling	noise.	I	want	to	see	if	I	can	see	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knelt	on	the	top	of	the	cabinet	and	ran	a	finger	through	a	layer	of	dust	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>grime.	 Some	 of	 it	 already	 smeared	 from	 Beth's	 earlier	 visit.	 The	 window	 was still	quite	dirty	even	though	she	had	managed	to	wipe	a	bit	of	the	dirt	away.	Her handprint	was	still	visible	in	the	remaining	filth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	small	gasp	escaped	my	lips	as	I	checked	out	my	first	view	of	outside.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	sky,	the	green	trees	–	everything	I	caught	sight	of	in	that	first	moment	called out	to	me.	My	hands	clenched	into	fists,	and	it	took	all	my	control	not	to	pound</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	window.	Freedom	was	within	reach,	and	it	frustrated	me.	I	rose	higher	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	knees	to	get	a	better	view.	A	light	touch	on	my	head	pulled	me	back	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distraction	outside,	and	I	looked	up.	The	first	rafter	was	just	above	the	top	of	the window,	 and	 I	 had	 brushed	 my	 head	 against	 it.  <i class="calibre3">That	 was	 close. </i>	 I	 ran	 my	 hand over	 the	 top	 of	 my	 head.	 The	 near	 collision	 made	 me	 aware	 of	 the	 need	 to	 be more	 careful.	 My	 awareness	 prompted	 thoughts;	 my	 thoughts	 prompted	 worry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	if	Cecil	catches	us? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	 me	 something	 to	 wipe	 this	 window	 with.”	 I	 shook	 my	 head	 in	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt	 to	 shift	 my	 thoughts	 from	 worrying	 about	 what	 might	 happen	 to	 the window	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	my	perch,	the	room	looked	as	bleak	as	it	did	at	ground	level.	I	stuck</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	hand	into	my	pocket;	my	fingers	grazed	over	the	key.	I	dug	further,	found	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth	 button,	 and	 pinched	 it	 between	 my	 fingers.	 My	 other	 hand	 smoothed down	 the	 skirt	 of	 my	 dress	 and	 snagged	 the	 pocket.	 The	 square	 of	 material ripped	 down	 both	 sides	 and	 hung	 from	 a	 few	 remaining	 threads	 along	 the bottom.	A	brighter	patch	of	green	showed	underneath.	I	reached	down	and	tore</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pocket	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	 put	 a	 bit	 of	 water	 on	 this.”	 I	 crouched	 and	 stretched	 out	 my	 arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	took	the	cloth	from	my	hand	and	moved	toward	our	water	bottles.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">snatched	one	from	the	table	and	returned	to	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	wet?”	Her	wide	icy	blue	eyes	stared	up	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	a	little.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	placed	the	cloth	over	the	end	and	tipped	the	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here.”	She	stretched	her	hand	up	toward	me;	water,	from	the	damp	piece	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloth,	dripped	down	her	arm.	I	reached	down	and	grabbed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wet	bit	of	material	moistened	the	dirt	on	the	window,	but	with	each	pass</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 made,	 it	 smeared	 even	 more.	 It	 wasn't	 making	 the	 window	 any	 clearer.	 If anything,	it	was	worse	than	it	had	been	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	not	working	s-so	well,”	Bethany	stated	the	obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	my	eyes.	“This	isn't	big	enough,”	I	said	as	I	pulled	my	dress	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	waist	and	used	the	underside	of	it	to	clean	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	getting	your	dress	dirty,”	Bethany	scolded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>“It's	 already	 dirty,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 wiped	 away	 as	 much	 filth	 as	 I	 could.	 When satisfied,	 I	 rested	 the	 side	 of	 my	 face	 on	 the	 cold	 and	 smooth	 glass.	 I	 squished my	 cheek	 harder	 as	 I	 tried	 to	 get	 a	 better	 look	 outside.	 “Uh!”	 I	 gasped	 and withdrew	my	face	away	from	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Bethany	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	window	moved.”	I	pressed	around	the	edges	of	the	round	window	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	for	more	movement.	But	I	saw	nothing.	“Get	me	something.”	Bethany's</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurried	footsteps	tapped	in	my	ears	as	I	continued	to	push	and	pry	at	the	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	my	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	and	looked	down	at	Bethany.	She	was	holding	up	the	peanut-butter-</p>
<p class="calibre1">coated	plastic	knife.	I	smiled,	crouched	down,	and	stretched	out	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!”	 Bethany	 said	 and	 licked	 the	 knife.	 “I	 don't	 w-want	 to	 waste	 it.”	 I watched	 with	 envy;	 she'd	 beaten	 me	 to	 what	 I'd	 planned	 on	 doing.	 When	 she finished,	she	stretched	up	her	arm	and	handed	me	the	licked-clean	knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	away	at	the	grey	stuff	that	held	the	window	in	place.	Some	tiny	bits</p>
<p class="calibre1">flaked	off	easier	than	others.	After	a	few	moments,	I	stopped.	I	wiped	a	piece	of damp	hair	from	my	eyes	and	wiped	the	sweat	from	my	forehead	with	the	back	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	hand.	It	was	going	to	take	a	lot	longer	than	I	thought.	I	sat	back	on	my	knees and	sighed.	We	wouldn't	be	escaping	anytime	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	get	it?”	Beth's	excited	voice	came	from	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it's	going	to	take	some	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you…sure	it	m-moved?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 at	 the	 window.	 “Yes.”	 My	 voice	 was	 confident,	 but	 in	 my	 head,	 I wondered	if	it	had	actually	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 well	 like	 you	 said,	 it	 will	 take	 time.”	 Her	 voice	 sounded	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed	 as	 I	 felt.	 “Did	 you	 see	 anything?”	 She	 regained	 her	 earlier excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany's	 question	 reminded	 me	 of	 the	 reason	 I'd	 climbed	 on	 top	 of	 the cabinet.	I	leaned	forward	on	my	knees	and	peered	out	the	much	cleaner	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	mixed	forest	of	tall	evergreens	and	leafy	trees	stretched	out	as	far	as	I	could see.	 I	 also	 spotted	 a	 detail	 Bethany	 had	 failed	 to	 mention	 earlier.	 Below	 the window	was	another	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	my	head	to	the	right	and	put	my	cheek	against	the	cold	glass.	Once</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	I	thought	I	detected	movement,	but	it	didn't	raise	any	more	hope.	If	it	had moved,	it	remained	firmly	attached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greens	 and	 browns	 of	 varying	 shades	 met	 my	 eyes	 as	 I	 looked	 out	 on	 the forest	that	encircled	our	prison.	A	flash	of	movement	caught	my	attention,	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful	blue	bird	flew	past.	I	gasped	in	awe. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>“What!”	Bethany	called	out	in	alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	a	bird.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oooh,	I	shouldn't	d-do	this	–	ah!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	over	my	shoulder	and	spotted	Beth	as	she	climbed	onto	the	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	coming	up,	m-move	over.”	She	reached	both	of	her	hands	towards	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	look	of	fear	and	determination	in	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.”	I	held	on	to	her	arms	and	steadied	her	as	she	pulled	herself	up	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	of	the	wardrobe.	“Okay?”	I	said	once	she	settled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	and	gave	me	a	weak	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	on	our	knees	and	took	turns	peering	out	the	window.	We	watched	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds	 flew	 by	 and	 were	 amazed	 when	 the	 occasional	 one	 landed	 on	 the	 roof below.	No	matter	how	hard	they'd	tried	to	recreate	a	forest	in	the	large	room	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">C.E.C.I.L.,	it	was	nothing	compared	to	the	real	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tall	trees	swayed	in	the	invisible	breeze.	The	odd	fluffy,	white	vaporous</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloud	dotted	the	bright	blue	sky.	Everything	was	vibrant	and	warm	as	the	rays	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sun	touched	the	world	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	that?”	Bethany	pulled	her	sweaty	cheek	away	from	the	window.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered	her	shoulder	length	hair	in	one	hand,	twisted	it,	and	held	it	in	place	on the	top	of	her	head.	Both	of	her	cheeks	had	reddened	from	pressing	them	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	glass,	and	I	was	sure	mine	looked	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	my	left	cheek	on	the	window.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Between	the	trees,	there's	an	opening	like	a	path	or	s-something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 right.	 It's	 a	 road.	 We	 must	 have	 come	 here	 in	 that	 truck	 you	 keep hearing.”	 My	 words	 reminded	 me	 that	 I'd	 forgotten	 to	 look	 for	 signs	 of	 some vehicle.	My	eyes	followed	along	the	dirt	path	from	between	the	trees	and	traced</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	back	toward	the	building.	There	was	a	road,	but	I	couldn't	tell	if	there	was	a vehicle	parked	out	front.	The	roof	below	the	window	blocked	out	the	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	t-turn.”	Bethany	tugged	on	my	dress,	and	I	moved	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 turned	 her	 head	 from	 left	 to	 right	 and	 back	 again.	 Every	 few	 seconds she	 uttered	 quiet	 expressions	 of	 delight.	 I	 was	 about	 to	 ask	 her	 to	 move	 over when	she	sat	back	from	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 g-getting	 dark.	 It's	 not	 night	 already…is	 it?”	 she	 said	 with	 a	 puzzled look	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	copied	her	expression.	We	hadn't	been	on	top	of	the	wardrobe	that	long.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	forward	and	peered	out.	The	blue	sky	had	turned	into	different	shades	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">swirling	 grey.	 Angry	 clouds	 pushed	 away	 the	 white	 puffs	 that	 we	 had	 enjoyed looking	at	minutes	before.	The	tops	of	the	green	trees	swayed	faster	as	the	wind</p>
<p class="calibre1">blew	them	around.	A	loud	rumble	shook	the	rafters. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>“What's	h-happening?”	Beth's	voice	wavered	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	placed	an	arm	around	her	shoulder.	“A	storm,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	pulled	back	and	looked	up	at	me;	her	eyes	wide.	“I	think	I	like	storms</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	as	m-much	as	heights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 right.	 You	 don't	 like	 storms,	 but	 I'm	 sure	 it	 will	 be	 over	 soon.	 It'll just	rain	hard	for	a	bit.	Don't	worry.”	I	patted	her	back.	Beth	had	no	real	memory of	how	much	she	hated	both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rain.”	 Bethany	 leaned	 forward	 and	 peered	 out	 the	 window.	 “Rain,”	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered	again.	“Mad	rain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	another	rumbling,	but	it	didn't	come	from	any	storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	back?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	nodded	and	 drew	away	from	 the	window.	We	 climbed	down	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cabinet	and	carried	our	table	and	chair	back	over	to	where	they	belonged.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiptoed	toward	our	mats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up	at	the	rain-washed	window	and	placed	my	hand	on	my	cheek.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	still	feel	the	slight	shift	of	the	window.  <i class="calibre3">It	had	moved</i>.	I	assured	myself;	the doubt	withered	and	died.	And	though	it	would	take	time,	hope	lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty-One	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Hidden	Secrets</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 storm	 outside	 kept	 us	 huddled	 together	 on	 my	 mat.	 Although	 Beth	 had begged	to	sit	on	the	cot,	I	had	no	intention	of	using	it	no	matter	how	comfortable it	looked.	Under	Beth's	protests,	we'd	folded	it	up	and	rolled	it	into	the	corner	of the	room	by	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	sat	beside	me,	close	enough	for	me	to	feel	her	body	heat.	She	drew</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	knees	up	to	her	chest	and	buried	her	face	into	them.	Her	dark	wavy	hair	fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	her.	Her	hands	rested	on	top	of	her	head,	and	she	would	cover	her	ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">whenever	the	thunder	boomed.	While	the	room	was	warm,	Beth	shook	like	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rafters	 with	 each	 crack	 of	 thunder.	 The	 rain	 pounded	 on	 the	 roof,	 and	 it	 was almost	deafening.	I	could	scarcely	hear	my	breath.	The	room	darkened	as	the	sky</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled	with	black	storm	clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It'll	be	over	soon,”	I	spoke	louder	than	usual.	I	hoped	I	was	right	as	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	no	sign	the	raging	storm	was	ending	soon.	I	reached	over	and	rubbed	Beth's</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	Her	blue	dress	was	damp	with	sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 turned	 her	 head	 to	 the	 side	 and	 looked	 at	 me	 through	 a	 lock	 of	 her untamed	hair.	“H-how	do	y-you	know?”	A	flash	of	lightning	filtered	in	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 window.	 An	 eerie	 blue	 glow	 brightened	 the	 room	 for	 a	 second.	 Beth squeezed	her	eyes	shut	and	buried	her	face	into	her	knees.	Her	hands	covered	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears	as	the	thunder	rolled	seconds	later.	“Ya,	sh-sure	it	is,”	she	said.	Her	words were	almost	lost	to	the	hammering	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 cradled	 my	 forehead	 in	 my	 palms	 and	 covered	 my	 eyes	 with	 the	 heels	 of my	hands.	“We	can,”	I	hesitated,	“play	a	game.”	Another	memory	had	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	Beth	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It'll	help	you	know	when	the	storm's	almost	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 looked	 up	 from	 her	 knees	 and	 wiped	 her	 sweaty	 face	 with	 her	 hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed.	“We	used	to	do	this	when	we	were	little.	Dad	showed	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	furrowed	her	brow.	“T-tell	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You'll	have	to	look	up	at	the	window.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	glanced	at	the	window	as	another	flash	of	lightning	lit	it	up.	She	buried</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 face	 and	 covered	 her	 ears.	 “I	 d-don't	 think	 th-that's	 a	 g-good	 idea,”	 she stammered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 promise	 it	 will	 help.	 It	 always	 did	 before.”	 I	 rested	 my	 hand	 on	 her shoulder;	her	body	trembled	under	my	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 raised	 her	 head	 and	 stared	 up	 at	 the	 window.	 “Okay,”	 she	 groaned, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“what	do	I	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>“Next	time	you	see	a	flash,	start	counting	one,	one-thousand,	two,	one-thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	okay	I	g-get	it.	Th-then	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop,	 when	 you	 hear	 the	 thunder.	 The	 longer	 the	 space	 between	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightening	and	the	thunder	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 further	 the	 storm,”	 Beth	 interrupted	 again.	 Her	 voice	 showed	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">excitement	than	fear.	Her	eyes	were	wide	as	she	stared	at	me.	“I	remember!”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">flung	her	arms	around	my	neck	and	almost	knocked	me	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	loud	crack	of	thunder	had	her	sitting	up	straight	in	an	instant.	Her	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered	her	ears,	but	she	didn't	close	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	remember?”	I	said.	My	voice	rose	over	the	din. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“Just	the	game,	though,	n-nothing	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it's	a	start.”	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stared	up	at	the	window,	and	it	wasn't	long	before	lightning	flashed;	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	lit	up	in	the	creepy	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One,”	 Beth	 started.	 It	 was	 as	 far	 as	 she	 got	 before	 thunder	 rattled	 the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrapped	an	arm	around	her.	“It's	okay.”	The	rain	pelted	against	the	glass.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	shape	slammed	into	the	pane.	The	resulting	crack	echoed	through	the	room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	hoped	whatever	it	was,	that	it	had	broken	the	glass.	Lightning	flashed,	and Bethany	counted	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mind	drifted	between	helping	Beth	count	and	my	hope	for	escape.	Every</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimistic	thought	was	rivaled	by	one	of	despair.	Soon,	the	impossibilities	piled up	 and	 drowned	 out	 any	 confidence	 I	 had	 had.	 By	 the	 time	 the	 storm	 ended,	 I had	argued	myself	out	of	freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	exhaled	as	all	the	tension	caused	by	the	storm	outside	and	the	one	raging	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	head	released	from	my	body.	My	shoulders	dropped,	and	I	hung	my	head	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	courageous	Beth	moved	back	to	her	mat.	The	thunder	and	lightning	had	moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">on,	and	the	room	lightened.	I	plucked	at	my	damp	dress	that	clung	to	my	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	 it	 over?”	 Beth	 said.	 The	 rain	 had	 eased	 to	 a	 rhythmic	 tapping,	 and	 she spoke	in	a	normal	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“I	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	 too.”	 She	 nodded	 in	 agreement	 and	 wiped	 a	 damp	 piece	 of	 hair	 away from	her	forehead.	She	reached	behind	her,	gathered	her	hair	into	a	ponytail	with one	hand,	and	lifted	it	high	off	her	neck.	“I	wish	I	had	an	elastic	or	s-something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	hot	in	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	copied	Beth	and	swept	my	damp	hair	away	from	my	neck	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	gaze	wandered	around	the	room	and	settled	on	the	cabinet.	I	drew	my	knees</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	my	chest	and	hugged	my	legs.	I	stared	at	my	feet.  <i class="calibre3">Don't	give	up</i>,	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>voice	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 head	 sprung	 up,	 and	 I	 looked	 at	 Beth.	 She	 was	 already	 lying	 down	 on her	mat	picking	away	at	it.  <i class="calibre3">Could	we	really	escape? </i>	The	thought	made	my	heart flutter.	 I	 squeezed	 my	 eyes	 shut;	 the	 argument	 in	 my	 head	 was	 not	 over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Optimism	 was	 pushing	 back	 against	 the	 pessimist.  <i class="calibre3">What	 if	 that	 window	 does</i> <i class="calibre3">come	free	–	then	what? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scrambled	to	my	feet.	The	memory	of	the	storm	and	the	loud	crack	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 window	 came	 to	 mind.	 I	 tiptoed	 toward	 the	 cabinet.	 The	 fear	 that	 Cecil would	hear	movement	and	wonder	what	we	were	up	to	was	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	you	doing?	Are	we	g-going	to	finally	open	some	boxes?”	Bethany's</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet,	box-obsessed	voice	called	out	from	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I'm	checking	the	window.”	I	stopped	in	front	of	the	cabinet	and	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up;	the	glass	was	still	intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	b-broken?”	Bethany's	warm	hand	slipped	into	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	on	tiptoe	and	searched	for	the	smallest	crack,	though	not	easy	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	my	vantage	point.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	w-want	to	climb	up	and	look?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	I	could	not	pull	my	gaze	from	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	open	a	box.”	Beth's	voice	was	almost	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed	and	closed	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	p-promised,	April.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	groaned	and	shook	my	hand	from	Beth's	grasp.	I	turned	around	and	headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 few	 steps	 back	 towards	 our	 mats.	 “Are	 you	 going	 to	 help?”	 I	 asked	 Beth, who	 hadn't	 moved.	 A	 wide	 grin	 spread	 across	 her	 face,	 and	 she	 tiptoed	 toward me.	We	picked	up	the	table	and	carried	it	over	to	the	enormous	closet	and	placed</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	in	front	of	its	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	into	the	remaining	pocket	of	my	dress	and	pulled	out	the	old	key</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	climbing	on	top	of	the	table.	I	unlocked	the	padlock	and	pulled	the	lock</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	metal	rings	then	placed	it	on	the	top	edge	of	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	 taking	 the	 table	 back	 first,”	 I	 told	 Bethany	 as	 I	 climbed	 down	 from my	perch.	She	nodded,	and	we	put	the	table	back	in	its	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	bit	my	lip	and	ran	my	fingers	through	my	tangled	hair.	My	hands	smoothed</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	skirt	of	my	dress	as	my	eyes	fixed	on	the	cabinet's	large	doors.	I	placed my	 hands	 on	 the	 knobs	 and	 hesitated	 for	 a	 second.	 A	 part	 of	 me	 hoped	 that Bethany	would	change	her	mind	and	give	up	on	the	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 heartbeat	 echoed	 in	 my	 ears,	 and	 I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 Beth	 was	 silent beside	me.	I	let	go	of	the	handles	and	turned	my	head	to	look	at	her.	She	smiled, and	her	eyes	sparkled.	I	sighed	and	rubbed	my	hands	on	my	dress	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	do	it.”	Beth	reached	out	her	hand	toward	the	cabinet	door;	I	grabbed	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two.”	She	was	stubborn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	two,	but	we	open	them	over	by	our	mats,	and	if	he	comes	you	hide	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">box	under	your	blanket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 nodded	 and	 reached	 back	 toward	 the	 doors	 again.	 I	 moved	 out	 of	 the way	 as	 her	 hands	 grabbed	 each	 knob.	 She	 gave	 a	 quick	 tug,	 and	 both	 doors swung	wide	open.	The	musty	smell	of	the	old	clothing	inside	stung	my	nose,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrinkled	it	instinctively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	corner	of	my	eye,	I	caught	my	old	faded	pyjama	bottoms	sitting	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	 of	 the	 boxes.	 I	 hadn't	 bothered	 hanging	 them	 back	 up	 and	 had	 tossed	 them inside	last	time	we	had	it	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurry	up	and	pick	two	boxes,”	I	spoke	with	little	enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	 ones?”	 Bethany	 looked	 at	 me;	 her	 eyebrows	 rose	 so	 high	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	met	her	hairline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	care,	Beth,	any.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	stood	still	for	a	moment	before	reaching	into	the	cabinet	and	pulling</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	a	box.	“This	one,”	she	shrugged,	“because	it	has	lots	of	pink	flowers	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 held	 out	 the	 carton.	 “I'm	 opening	 it,”	 she	 added.	 Pink,	 marker-scribbled flowers	covered	the	box;	even	the	stems	and	leaves	were	pink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	reached	back	into	the	cabinet,	rearranged	some	of	the	cartons,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">chose	 the	 second	 one.	 She	 handed	 it	 to	 me	 and	 took	 the	 one	 she'd	 claimed	 for herself	from	my	hands.	“This	one's	yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 the	 box	 in	 my	 hands.	 A	 jumbled	 mess	 of	 multi-coloured	 lettering covered	 it.	 It	 was	 almost	 impossible	 to	 pick	 out	 any	 real	 words.	 “Beth!”	 I warned.	She	had	already	slid	the	lid	off	from	the	box	she	held	and	was	peaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	 She	 replaced	 the	 lid	 and	 looked	 at	 me	 with	 innocent	 eyes.	 Beth batted	her	lids	for	effect.	She	then	turned	and	headed	back	toward	the	mats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head,	closed	the	doors	of	the	cabinet	and	joined	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty-Two	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Secrets	Exposed</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 moment	 we'd	 returned	 to	 our	 mats,	 Beth	 already	 had	 the	 box	 top	 off.	 She picked	through	the	contents	with	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There's	 not	 m-much	 in	 here,”	 she	 said	 in	 a	 somewhat	 disappointed	 tone, and	she	pulled	her	hand	out	of	the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	expect?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	tangled	hair	hung	in	front	of	her	face	as	she	stared	at	the	contents	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	small	carton.	After	a	moment,	she	shrugged.	“I	don't	know,”	she	mumbled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“something	 interesting!”	 She	 reached	 in	 and	 again	 stirred	 the	 items	 with	 her finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I'm	hoping	for	more	 <i class="calibre3">useful</i>	than	 <i class="calibre3">interesting</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	 what?”	 She	 whipped	 her	 head	 back,	 and	 her	 icy	 blue	 eyes	 fixed	 on mine	for	a	moment.	Her	mouth	pulled	into	a	straight	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“I	don't	know.	Something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	put	her	box	down	beside	her	and	reached	inside.	She	pulled	out	a	small, </p>
<p class="calibre1">solid	 object.	 “This	 is	 n-neither	 interesting	 nor	 useful,”	 she	 said,	 holding	 up	 the small	rock	in	the	palm	of	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 picked	 it	 up	 and	 held	 it	 between	 my	 thumb	 and	 index	 finger.	 The	 small grey	stone	was	cold	and	rough.	It	reminded	me	of	the	day	I	almost	reached	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 touched	 a	 much	 larger	 rock	 at	 C.E.C.I.L.  <i class="calibre3">Or	 fake	 rock</i>,	 I	 thought.	 I	 would never	 know	 the	 boulder's	 authenticity,	 but	 I	 still	 wondered.	 I	 shook	 away	 my thoughts	and	handed	the	stone	back	to	her.	“What	else	is	in	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	pulled	out	another	object	and	grimaced.	“Ew!”	She	wrinkled	her	nose</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 held	 up	 a	 lock	 of	 hair	 she	 pinched	 between	 her	 fingers.	 A	 green	 ribbon dangled	 from	 the	 other	 end.	 Then	 she	 dropped	 it	 back	 inside	 and	 pulled	 out	 a crumpled-up	piece	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	 let	 me	 get	 that.”	 The	 sight	 of	 the	 paper	 caused	 the	 memory	 of	 my drawing	to	resurface.	I	reached	out	for	the	ball	of	paper,	but	Beth	put	it	behind her	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	my	box;	I'll	d-do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	growing	impatient	as	she	unfolded	the	wadded	paper.	I	wanted	to	reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	and	snatch	it	from	her	hands,	but	I	resisted.	Finally,	she	smoothed	it	out	on the	floor	beside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	some	kind	of	w-weird	drawing,”	she	said	as	she	placed	it	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 picked	 up	 the	 wrinkled	 sheet	 and	 turned	 it	 around.	 A	 dizzying	 pattern	 of blue	 and	 yellow	 circles	 and	 swirls	 covered	 the	 page.	 I	 turned	 it	 slowly;	 the curved	lines	appeared	to	move	along	with	the	paper.	I	squinted	and	focused	on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>the	centre.	Inside	the	pattern	was	something	more	intelligible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 stick	 figure	 family	 peered	 out;	 forever	 trapped	 inside	 a	 strange	 hypnotic swirl.	 I	 concentrated	 on	 the	 focal	 point.	 The	 longer	 I	 stared	 at	 it,	 the	 more	 the curved	lines	seemed	to	disappear.	Eventually,	the	stick	figures	became	clearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	 larger	 forms	 stood	 close	 together	 with	 a	 smaller	 one	 standing	 off	 to one	 side.	 The	 artist	 had	 paid	 close	 attention	 to	 the	 lone	 stick	 person	 and	 had added	 more	 details.	 The	 figure	 had	 long	 yellow	 hair,	 and	 large	 blue	 tears	 fell from	the	eyes.	The	other	figures	were	faceless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 drew	 a	 deep	 breath.	 My	 lungs	 expanded	 and	 relieved	 the	 tightness	 that suddenly	 came	 over	 me	 as	 I	 stared	 at	 the	 sad	 picture	 in	 my	 hands.	 I	 started	 to give	 it	 back	 to	 Beth	 when	 another	 detail	 caught	 my	 eye.	 I	 brought	 the	 paper closer.	Small	green	ribbons	hung	from	the	ends	of	the	long,	blond	hair	–	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	the	lock	Beth	had	pulled	from	the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shuddered	and	closed	my	eyes	for	a	moment.	“Is	there	anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya,	 one	 more	 thing.”	 Bethany	 pulled	 out	 a	 small,	 blue-velvety	 bag	 with yellow	cords.	“What	do	you	th-think's	in	here?”	Her	eyes	widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	I	could	answer	her,	Beth	began	untying	the	strings	that	held	the	bag</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed.	When	she	had	it	untied,	she	dumped	the	contents	into	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	 She	 picked	 up	 the	 golden	 bracelet	 and	 held	 it	 up	 in	 front	 of	 her.	 A small	heart	shaped	charm	swung	back	and	forth.	She	reached	up	and	steadied	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	other	hand.	“It's	almost	like	your	heart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 tiny	 solid	 charm	 was	 smooth;	 the	 one	 on	 my	 necklace	 was	 larger	 and flatter.	 I	 pulled	 my	 chain	 out	 from	 under	 my	 dress	 and	 pressed	 my	 chin	 to	 my chest	to	get	a	better	look.	But,	it	wasn't	easy	to	see,	and	for	the	second	time	since discovering	it,	I	removed	the	chain	and	held	the	heart	in	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	g-guess	it's	not	like	yours,”	Beth's	voice	broke	through	my	thoughts.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed	 the	 bracelet	 in	 my	 hand	 and	 aligned	 the	 two	 hearts.	 The	 only	 similarity was	the	shape.	“I	like	yours	m-more.	It's	bigger	and	has	a	butterfly	on	it.”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	up	my	charm	and	held	it	close	to	her	eyes,	turning	and	inspecting	it	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	angle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sucked	my	lips	inward	as	the	urge	to	tell	her	she	had	one	too	was	strong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	stopped	myself.	Telling	her	would	not	make	it	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yours	also	h-has	this	really	thin	line,	almost	like	a	crack	around	the	edge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except	for	here.”	She	pointed	to	an	area	on	the	side	of	the	heart,	but	her	finger was	in	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">This	is	a	very	special	heart,”	dad	said,	and	he	held	up	my	necklace	in	front	of</i> <i class="calibre3">me.	Mom	had	left	my	room	to	see	where	Benny	was. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What	 do	 you	 mean?”	 I	 said,	 staring	 at	 the	 dangling	 piece	 of	 jewelry.	 It</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a> <i class="calibre3">glinted	in	the	sunlight	streaming	in	through	my	window. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">It	holds	secrets. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">My	eyes	widened.	“It	does.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dad	nodded.	“Hmm.	You	just	have	to	open	your	heart,	Av.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">My	face	scrunched.	“What	do	you	mean?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Oh!	I	better	go	help	your	mother,	before	I	get	into	trouble.	Happy	birthday, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">sweetheart.”	He	rose	from	my	bed	and	kissed	the	top	of	my	head. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	it	to	me,”	I	snapped	at	Bethany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!	 You	 don't	 h-have	 to	 be	 rude.”	 Bethany's	 eyes	 became	 slits	 as	 she handed	back	my	necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	I	said	in	a	quieter	tone.	“I	want	to	look	at	something.”	I	traded	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bracelet	for	my	necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	the	heart	in	my	hands,	as	Beth	had.	The	thin	line	around	the	edge	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 charm	 did	 not	 go	 all	 the	 way	 around.	 I	 ran	 a	 fingernail	 along	 the	 narrow groove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	Beth	sat	in	front	of	me	with	her	arms	crossed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	this	opens,”	I	said	and	continued	to	try	and	open	the	tiny	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	several	frustrating	moments,	I	gave	up.	“Maybe	I'm	wrong.”	I	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	necklace	dangled	from	my	hand	as	I	rested	my	forehead	in	my	palms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	try?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	looking	up,	I	handed	her	the	chain.	I	stared	at	the	wooden	floor	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	my	crossed	legs	and	poked	at	a	nail	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	grumbled.	“Here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	piece	of	jewelry	from	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“M-maybe	it	doesn't	open,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	words	made	my	heart	sink	a	little	more.	I	wanted	to	be	right;	I	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 heart	 to	 open.	 Because	 if	 it	 did	 open,	 maybe	 there	 would	 be	 something inside,	something	that	would	remind	us	of	our	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	 the	 stuff	 back	 in	 your	 box,”	 I	 said.	 I	 stood	 up	 and	 stretched	 my	 arms over	my	head;	each	tiny	vertebra	snapped	and	moved	back	into	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	 what	 about	 your	 box?”	 Bethany	 pointed	 to	 the	 carton	 on	 my	 mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	promised,”	she	added	before	I	could	argue	the	point	of	not	looking	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	shoebox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	I	huffed	and	plunked	myself	back	down,	pulled	the	lid	from	the	box, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	dumped	the	contents	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	crayon	drawing	of	a	sad	child	lay	in	front	of	us.	I	folded	it	up	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanting	to	look	at	the	image	any	longer	than	I	had	to.	A	gnawed	pencil	rolled	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor.	I	imagined	the	owner	had	been	so	hungry	she'd	resorted	to	chewing	on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>it,	and	another	rock,	this	one	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 are	 m-more	 things	 in	 your	 box,”	 Bethany	 spoke	 in	 a	 quiet	 voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	that?”	She	pointed	to	a	small,	round	object	that	had	rolled	from	the	box</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	had	stopped	when	it	hit	the	edge	of	her	mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 a…a	 marble.”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 picked	 up	 the	 smooth	 coloured	 object,	 “Dad showed	me	one	once.”	The	memory	popped	into	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	scrunched	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	a	kind	of	a	toy,”	I	tried	to	explain.	I	didn't	quite	know	how	one	played</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	it,	but	I	knew	what	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	kind	of	like	a	s-stupid	toy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	agreed	and	tossed	the	marble	back	into	the	box	along	with	the	pencil</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	folded	drawing.	Three	more	items	remained	on	the	floor	in	front	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that?”	Bethany	pointed	to	a	flat	piece	of	rough	metal	with	a	point	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	end	and	a	plastic	handle	on	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	it	up	and	turned	it	around	in	my	hands.	The	flat	piece	of	metal	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">thin	and	bendy.	I	ran	my	finger	over	its	surface.	It	scratched	up	the	skin	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">finger	and	left	a	white	powder	residue	behind.	I	brought	it	closer	to	my	eyes	and turned	it	over	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 it's…”	 I	 paused	 and	 searched	 for	 the	 correct	 word.	 The	 tip	 of	 my finger	pressed	down	on	the	point.	“I	think	it's	a	nail	file.”	I	ran	it	over	my	short fingernails	and	watched	as	tiny	bits	of	dust	floated	to	the	floor.	“Mom	had	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	like	this,	though.”	A	vague	memory	of	her	painting	my	nails	came	to	mind.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	 my	 eyes	 and	 stopped	 the	 memory	 from	 going	 any	 further.	 I	 slid	 the	 file under	my	mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	you	doing?”	Bethany	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“We	might	be	able	to	use	it	on	the	window	instead	of	that	plastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">knife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	two	objects	left,	a	white	feather	and	a	soft	blue	bag.	I	picked	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	feather,	raised	it	above	my	head	and	let	it	go.	It	floated	down	with	grace	and landed	back	inside	the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	open	the	little	b-bag?”	Bethany	said	as	she	picked	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	sack	and	dangled	it	from	its	strings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shrugged,	 and	 she	 untied	 the	 cords.	 When	 she	 had	 the	 bag	 open,	 she dumped	 the	 contents	 out	 into	 her	 hand.	 A	 small	 tooth	 landed	 in	 her	 palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	yelped	and	dropped	it	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty-Three	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Come	to	me	my	Children</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 not	 a	 dream;	 the	 floor	 creaked	 as	 someone	 shuffled	 across	 it.	 I	 held	 my breath	and	peeked	through	the	half-open	eyelid	of	one	eye.	A	pale,	yellow	glow</p>
<p class="calibre1">illuminated	Bethany's	sleeping	form,	and	I	knew	the	door	was	open	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 lay	 quiet.	 My	 ears	 pricked	 to	 the	 sound	 of	 footsteps	 and	 a	 stifled	 cough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 muscle	 in	 my	 body	 twitched,	 urging	 me	 to	 roll	 over.	 I	 was	 desperate	 to know	 if	 the	 late-night	 visitor	 was	 Jasper.	 But	 my	 imagination	 proved	 stronger than	my	desire,	and	I	did	not	move.  <i class="calibre3">It	might	just	as	well	be	Cecil</i>,	a	little	voice inside	my	head	warned.	In	the	same	moment,	a	familiar	smell	wafted	toward	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	was	glad	I'd	stayed	still.	The	pointy	nail	file	I'd	slid	under	my	mat	came	to mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	fingers	searched	under	the	edge	of	the	foam	pad	and	brushed	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold,	metal	object.	I	slid	it	out	and	held	it	close	to	my	body.	Sweat	trickled	down my	forehead	as	my	imagination	took	over.	Thoughts	of	Cecil	attacking	us	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night	invaded	my	brain.	I	planned	our	self-defence	and	waited	for	his	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	each	creaking	of	the	floorboards,	my	heart	quickened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">How	dare	you? </i>”	His	voice	whispered	inside	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gripped	the	nail	file	tighter.	I	did	dare. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	one	eye	and	then	the	other.	Soft	sunlight	illuminated	the	small	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	lightened	the	room.	Beth's	sleeping	form	faced	me,	her	quiet	breaths	a	sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	she	slept	peaceful	and	sound.	I	looked	down	at	my	left	hand	and	the	nail	file clutched	 inside.	 A	 moment	 later,	 I	 was	 both	 relieved	 and	 disappointed.	 Cecil hadn't	 approached,	 and	 I	 hadn't	 gotten	 the	 chance	 to	 show	 him	 how	 much	 I dared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	the	thought	away.	My	action	cleared	my	head	and	reminded	me	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	main	purpose	I	had	for	the	tool.	I	pushed	back	the	thin	sheet	that	covered	me and	sat	up;	my	attention	focused	on	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 wasn't	 heavy	 but	 awkward	 as	 I	 managed	 to	 carry	 the	 table	 over	 to	 the cabinet.	Once	in	place,	I	snuck	back	and	picked	up	my	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	 on	 top	 of	 the	 chair	 was	 a	 little	 more	 daunting	 without	 Bethany securing	it	on	the	top	of	the	table.	But	somehow	I	managed	and	didn't	cause	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	of	a	raucous.	My	sister	slept	as	I	climbed	on	top	of	the	wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere	the	sun	had	risen	above	the	horizon,	and	fiery	hues	painted	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky.	 For	 me,	 the	 horizon	 was	 the	 treetops,	 and	 the	 early	 morning	 sun	 had	 only begun	to	lighten	the	sky	above	them.	A	single	star	twinkled,	a	stubborn	remnant</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>I	 caught	 a	 glimpse	 of	 red	 taillights	 off	 in	 the	 distance.	 I	 leaned	 my	 cheek against	 the	 cold	 window	 and	 watched	 as	 his	 old	 truck	 drove	 down	 the	 road.	 I stabbed	the	old	nail	file	into	the	rubbery	stuff	around	the	window	and	began	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">process	of	trying	to	remove	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	you	doing?”	Beth's	sleepy	voice	behind	me	caused	me	to	jump	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	drop	the	nail	file. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trying…”	I	jabbed	the	point	of	the	file	back	into	the	rubbery	gunk.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">tougher	than	I	thought,	and	in	the	time	I'd	been	digging	not	much	progress	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 made.	 With	 my	 free	 hand,	 I	 wiped	 away	 a	 bit	 of	 sweat	 that	 had	 trickled down	my	forehead.	“To.	Get.	Us.	Out.”	I	punctuated	each	word	with	a	jab	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	working?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	back	on	my	knees,	closed	my	eyes,	and	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	harder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grumbled.	“It's	not	going	to	work.”	A	sense	of	defeat	came	over	me	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	I'd	been	thinking	came	from	my	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	g-give	up,”	Bethany	pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn't	 want	 to	 give	 up;	 there	 wasn't	 anything	 more	 important	 than	 getting Bethany	 and	 myself	 out	 of	 there.	 We	 could	 not	 trust	 Cecil,	 and	 Jasper	 was	 too sick	to	help.	It	wasn't	clear	if	our	imprisonment	was	one	of	determined	length	or if	our	release	was	anytime	soon.	Our	freedom	relied	upon	escape	and	every	cell</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	body	understood	that	to	be	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	t-try?”	Bethany's	voice	broke	through	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	back	on	my	knees	and	shrugged.	“There's	no	point.	It's	too	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	do	it,	April.”	Beth's	voice	whispered	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	around	and	sat	on	the	top	of	the	cabinet	with	my	legs	hanging	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	edge.	I	swung	my	feet	and	banged	my	heels	into	the	closet	doors.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold,	metal	bar	pressed	into	my	calves,	and	the	doors	rattled	with	each	strike.	I did	not	care	about	the	noise	I	made.	“What	makes	you	so	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	reached	up	and	wrapped	a	hand	around	each	of	my	ankles.	I	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“I	don't	know.	I	j-just	think	you	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	remembered	s-something.”	She	looked	up	at	me	with	wide,	icy	blue	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	 I	 leaned	 forward	 and	 looked	 down	 at	 Beth;	 she	 had	 my	 full</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	isn't	much.”	She	squeezed	my	foot.	“You	made	me	feel	better	when	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">s-sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>I	squinted	and	rubbed	my	forehead	with	my	fingertips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	remember.	When?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 closed	 her	 eyes.	 “I	 was	 little	 and	 had	 a	 stomach	 ache.	 You	 s-sang	 to me.”	Beth	looked	at	me	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 did	 I	 sing?”	 I	 questioned.	 There	 was	 the	 tiniest	 bit	 of	 something,	 a tune,	but	it	was	too	far	away	to	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sat	down	on	the	floor,	squeezed	her	eyes	shut,	and	she	began	to	hum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quiet	 and	 stilted	 at	 first	 and	 then	 she	 found	 the	 rhythm.	 I	 shut	 my	 eyes	 and focused	on	the	sound,	the	tune	was	familiar	and	the	same	one	I'd	struggled	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	C.E.C.I.L. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	 voice	 was	 pleasant,	 and	 when	 she	 sang	 her	 stutter	 disappeared.	 She inserted	 the	 occasional	 word	 between	 strings	 of	 humming.	 The	 song	 became more	defined	as	she	repeated	the	same	verse.	The	tune	was	pretty,	and	after	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifth	 time	 through,	 I	 found	 my	 voice	 and	 sang	 along.	 Occasionally,	 I	 filled	 in hums	with	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	remember	it,”	I	said	interrupting	another	chorus.	“What's	it	called?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	looked	up	at	me	and	shrugged.	“I	don't	r-remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	singing.”	I	concentrated	on	the	tune	and	Beth's	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sang	the	words	and	hummed	the	tune.	Every	so	often	I	interrupted	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	new	word	and	corrected	when	I	thought	the	lyrics	were	wrong.	With	each	new</p>
<p class="calibre1">addition	or	correction,	Beth	began	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	start	anew	hmm	hmm	–	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	'We'll	start	anew,	my	children'.”	I	blurted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	folded	her	arms	and	scowled	at	me.	“Either	you	w-want	me	to	sing	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">n-not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	you	to	sing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	STOP	interrupting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	out	my	hands	and	conceded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 started	 over,	 and	 I	 kept	 quiet.	 The	 end	 of	 one	 verse	 prompted	 the memory	of	another.	The	humming	and	filling	in	the	blanks	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	on,”	I	urged	when	Beth	stopped	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	start	anew…”	She	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	next?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	didn't	want	to	be	interrupted?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shrugged.	“It's	harder	when	you're	n-not	helping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rolled	 my	 eyes	 and	 helped.	 When	 we	 grew	 tired,	 we	 had	 three	 partially completed	versus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>We	 were	 silent.	 Beth	 lay	 back	 on	 the	 floor	 and	 covered	 her	 face	 with	 her arm.	The	song	and	its	broken	lyrics	rolled	through	my	head,	permanently	etched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	remember	the	whole	song,”	she	said.	“It	seems	a	lot	more…”	She	sat	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	scratched	her	head,	“sinister.”	We	caught	each	other's	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sing	it,	Beth.	I	won't	interrupt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	closed	her	eyes.	“Come	to	me	my	children,	and	safe	you	will	be.	We're</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 that's	 left	 in	 this	 world,	 only	 you	 and	 me.	 We'll	 start	 anew	 my	 children,	 a world	 we	 will	 embrace.	 Only	 smart	 and	 special	 ones	 will	 live	 in	 this	 place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listen	 to	 me	 my	 children,	 so	 happy	 you	 will	 be.	 And	 when	 it's	 time	 to	 start afresh	we	will	all…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	 free,”	 I	 whispered.	 I	 climbed	 down	 onto	 the	 chair	 and	 table.	 When	 I reached	the	floor,	I	wrapped	my	arms	around	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	th-think	he	wrote	it?”	Beth	pulled	away	and	looked	at	me.	Her	icy</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	eyes	stared	through	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cecil.	I	think	he	wrote	that	s-song.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 I	 sang	 it	 to	 you	 when	 we	 were	 kids,	 before	 any	 of	 this.”	 I	 waved	 my hand	around	our	prison.	“Besides,	we	didn't	know	him	then.	He	didn't	know	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 shook	 her	 head.	 “Didn't	 we?	 How	 do	 we	 even	 know	 that	 the	 m-</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories	we	have	are	real?	Maybe	they're	n-not	ours.	Maybe	they	are	p-planted</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	our	heads.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	they're	real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know?”	Bethany's	voice	shook.	“How	can	you	b-be	so	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	the	necklace	free	from	my	dress	and	rubbed	the	heart	between	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers.	“Because	of	this.”	I	held	it	up	to	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 do	 you	 know	 th-that	 wasn't	 placed	 around	 your	 n-neck	 just	 to	 make the	memories	seem	real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	stomach	clenched	–	 <i class="calibre3">it	 had	 to	 be	 real</i>.	 “It's	 real,	 I'm	 sure.”	 I	 tucked	 the heart	back	underneath	my	dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	song?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“Maybe	we've	known	it	for	so	long	because…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	narrowed	my	eyes	as	an	incredulous	thought	stirred	in	my	mind.	“Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	 knew	 that	 we	 would	 be	 at	 C.E.C.I.L	 someday?	 Because	 someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">planned	all	this	from	the	beginning	or	at	least	part	of	it?	It's	all	too	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	who	are	we	s-supposed	to	listen	to?	Cecil?”	Beth's	question	made	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	stand	up	on	the	back	of	my	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	memory	of	Jasper's	words	whispered	in	my	ear.	“<i class="calibre3">His	voice	would	be	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">only	one	to	elicit	that	sort	of	response.	I	overheard	once	that	it	had	something	to</i> <i class="calibre3">do	with	a	song. </i>”	I	shook	my	head.	“I	don't	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>“Will	we	b-be	free?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 gaze	 fell	 on	 the	 entrance	 to	 the	 room.	 “No,	 I	 don't	 think	 so.”	 I	 looked back	at	Beth.	“I	don't	think	things	worked	out	the	way	they	were	supposed	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	“I	don't	think	so	either.”	Beth	crossed	her	arms.	“So,	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	g-going	to	try	again?”	She	flicked	her	head	back	and	pointed	her	chin	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction	of	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	over	at	the	round	piece	of	glass.	“Maybe	later,	let's	see	what's	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	first.”	I	pointed	to	the	five	large	containers	sitting	in	the	corner	at	the	other end	of	the	room.	It	must	have	been	what	he	had	been	doing,	the	noise	of	sliding</p>
<p class="calibre1">boxes	across	the	floor	that	had	woken	me.	And	in	the	opposite	corner,	the	unused</p>
<p class="calibre1">cot	was	pushed	up	against	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	any	idea?”	Bethany	pointed	at	the	containers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	each	one	a	little	shove;	some	moved	easier	than	others.	“Not	a	clue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here,	help	me	with	this	one.”	I	put	my	hands	on	a	large	carton;	and	with	Beth's</p>
<p class="calibre1">help,	we	pulled	it	away	from	the	wall.	I	withdrew	the	file	from	my	pocket	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	it	to	break	through	the	tape	that	held	it	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	 books!”	 Beth	 said	 as	 we	 opened	 the	 flaps	 of	 the	 box.	 She	 reached inside	and,	one	at	a	time,	removed	the	books,	piling	them	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	look	like	every	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Book	w-we	had	at	C.E.C.I.L.”	Beth	finished	my	sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	out	the	last	and	turned	the	text	over	in	my	hands.	“Except	for	one, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	history	book.”	I	set	the	text	on	top	of	the	pile	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	box	I	opened	was	much	smaller	and	lighter.	Inside	were	numerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheets	 of	 paper	 covered	 with	 drawings.	 Apart	 from	 my	 or	 Beth's	 ID	 written somewhere	on	the	page,	they	were	unrecognizable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	remember	doing	these?”	I	held	up	an	illustration	in	each	hand	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	 ID	 scribbled	 on	 the	 back.	 She	 squinted,	 shook	 her	 head,	 and	 returned	 to the	pile	of	books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	on	the	floor	beside	Beth	and	sorted	through	the	box.	I	was	anxious	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	 the	 one	 picture	 I	 remembered	 creating.	 That	 tiny	 spark	 of	 hope	 I	 clung	 to reignited.	 As	 I	 sifted	 through	 the	 last	 few	 pieces,	 my	 throat	 tightened,	 and	 I swallowed	the	pain.	The	Illustration	was	nowhere	in	sight.	The	only	clue	I	had	to some	buried	memory	was	lost.	I	had	to	douse	whatever	hope	I	had	of	finding	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 dug	 back	 through	 the	 images	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 colourful	 and	 well-drawn picture	of	a	family	of	four.	I	studied	the	illustration,	losing	myself	in	the	detail	of a	 happy	 family	 enjoying	 a	 picnic.	 Two	 brown	 haired,	 little	 girls	 played	 with	 a ball	 while	 their	 parents	 watched,	 smiles	 pasted	 on	 their	 faces.	 The	 father	 sat behind	 the	 mother.	 His	 hands	 wrapped	 around	 her	 middle	 and	 rested	 on	 her protruding	belly.	The	drawing	was	unrecognizable	to	me,	and	if	it	weren't	for	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>ID	written	in	the	bottom	corner,	I	would	never	have	known	it	was	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	you've	found	your	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 unexpected	 voice	 caused	 me	 to	 jump,	 and	 Beth	 squealed.	 We	 were	 so enraptured	 with	 our	 pictures	 and	 books	 we	 never	 heard	 him	 enter.	 I	 grabbed Beth's	arm,	and	we	both	jumped	to	our	feet	and	turned	to	face	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 should	 choose	 some	 of	 your	 most	 favourite	 things	 and	 place	 them	 in these,”	 he	 sneered.	 He	 held	 up	 two	 small	 boxes,	 one	 in	 each	 hand.	 Colourful drawings,	 scribbles,	 letters,	 and	 numbers	 decorated	 the	 cartons	 –	 one	 was somewhat	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 bead	 of	 sweat	 trickled	 from	 his	 temple	 and	 down	 his	 cheek.	 It	 travelled along	the	sharp	angle	of	his	jaw	and	disappeared	underneath.	It	reappeared	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 rolled	 down	 his	 neck,	 soaking	 into	 the	 collar	 of	 his	 purple	 shirt.	 His	 sneer evaporated	 as	 a	 coughing	 fit	 caught	 him	 off	 guard.	 When	 he	 recovered,	 he dropped	 the	 two	 boxes	 on	 the	 floor,	 turned,	 and	 left	 the	 room	 without	 uttering another	 word.	 The	 distinctive	 sound	 of	 a	 turning	 lock	 interrupted	 the	 quiet	 -	 it was	a	sound	we	were	growing	used	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 at	 the	 shoeboxes	 he'd	 dropped	 on	 the	 floor	 and	 kicked	 them	 up against	 the	 wall.  <i class="calibre3">What	 does	 he	 expect	 us	 to	 put	 in	 these? </i>	 I	 reached	 up	 and touched	my	upper	chest	feeling	the	heart	pendant	underneath	my	dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	we'll	ever	see	J-Jasper	again?”	Beth	said	from	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know.	I	hope	so.”	I	turned	and	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	you	w-want	to	see	what's	in	the	other	boxes?”	Bethany's	voice	called</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	me	as	I	moved	toward	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	around	and	faced	my	sister.	“I'm	working	on	the	window.”	I	stabbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	air	over	my	shoulder	with	the	nail	file. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	much	easier	climbing	up	on	top	of	the	cabinet	with	Bethany	steadying</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 table.	 Within	 seconds,	 I	 was	 digging	 into	 the	 stuff	 that	 sealed	 the	 window into	place.	The	point	of	the	file	drove	into	the	rubbery	substance,	and	I	pulled	up on	it.	A	tiny	piece	loosened.	I	stabbed	again	in	the	same	spot,	forcing	the	nail	file deeper.	 I	 wiggled	 it,	 and	 a	 small	 piece	 broke	 free	 and	 fell	 onto	 the	 cabinet.	 I jabbed	again	and	finally	succeeded	in	breaking	off	a	chunk.	It	wasn't	much,	but	it gave	me	hope	as	I	sunk	the	file	in	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	he	noticed?”	Bethany's	voice	came	from	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Noticed	what?”	I	stabbed	into	the	thick	and	hard	gunk	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	table	and	chair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stopped.	 Bile	 rose	 up	 my	 throat,	 and	 my	 stomach	 rolled.	 We	 hadn't	 put</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>them	 back	 when	 we'd	 decided	 to	 investigate	 the	 boxes.	 My	 head	 spun	 with questions.  <i class="calibre3">What	 if	 he	 did	 see	 it?	 What	 is	 he	 going	 to	 do?	 Why	 didn't	 he	 say</i> <i class="calibre3">anything?	Maybe	he	didn't	notice. </i>	I	tried	to	allay	my	fears.  <i class="calibre3">Did	he	even	look	over</i> <i class="calibre3">at	the	cabinet?	No, </i>	I	convinced	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 didn't	 notice.”	 I	 stabbed	 the	 point	 in	 and	 worked	 at	 another	 loosened piece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“'Cause,	 I	 do,”	 I	 snapped,	 stabbing	 at	 the	 rubbery	 gunk.	 I	 missed	 and	 the point	of	the	file	sunk	into	the	wood.	I	sat	back	on	my	knees	and	closed	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	thumped	in	my	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	me	some	time	to	answer,	and	I	knew	when	I	did,	it	wasn't	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	Beth	wanted	to	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	the	file	from	the	wood	before	ramming	it	in	as	hard	as	I	could	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sealant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty-Four	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Unexpected	Visitor</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	found	another	use	for	the	file	besides	picking	at	the	window	and	using	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Underneath	my	mat,	I	had	begun	to	scratch	small	marks	into	the	floorboards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	idea	was	to	keep	track	of	how	long	we'd	been	in	the	room,	but	it	wasn't	easy</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 each	 day	 blended	 into	 the	 next.	 There	 were	 sixteen	 small	 scratches	 in	 the floor,	though	I	wasn't	sure	if	I	had	missed	any. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 g-going	 work	 at	 the	 w-window	 t-today?”	 Beth	 said	 in	 her	 sleepy morning	voice	as	I	finished	scratching	the	seventeenth	mark	into	the	floor.	Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	almost	invisible	in	the	dim	light	of	the	room,	and	her	question	surprised	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hadn't	asked	about	the	window	in	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tucked	my	file	under	my	mat	and	rolled	over	onto	my	back.	I	stared	up	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wooden	beams.	It	had	been	more	than	a	week	since	I'd	last	tried.	I	lay	quiet, and	I	listened	to	the	world	around	us;	Bethany's	breathing,	the	gentle	rain	on	the roof,	and	the	deep	growl	that	came	from	our	stomachs.	Sometimes	it	was	hard	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	whose	stomach	growled	louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	eating.”	Bethany	rose	from	her	mat	and	walked	over	to	the	table,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	remained	still,	flat	on	my	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	is	left?”	I	said	though	I	already	knew	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-not	m-much,”	Bethany	faltered.	Her	stutter	had	become	more	noticeable</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	past	couple	of	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We'd	had	no	bread	for	a	week	and	nothing	more	than	a	spoonful	of	peanut</p>
<p class="calibre1">butter	 and	 a	 few	 sips	 of	 water	 at	 each	 meal	 over	 the	 past	 five	 days.	 Water	 was about	all	Cecil	brought	us	anymore,	that	and	the	occasional	rotted	fruit.	The	box of	stale	cereal	was	long	gone	–	we	were	starving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 got	 up	 and	 made	 my	 way	 to	 the	 table	 for	 my	 spoonful	 of	 peanut	 butter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	was	right	there	wasn't	much	left,	not	enough	to	finish	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	in	silence	at	the	table	and	listened	to	the	rain.	Neither	of	us	had	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy	to	read	or	even	flip	through	the	books	we	had.	Our	decorated	shoeboxes</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat	in	the	corner	of	the	room	–	untouched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	thoughts	turned	to	the	other	cartons	in	the	cabinet.	We'd	only	opened	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">despite	Beth's	urging	to	open	more,	but	she'd	given	up	asking	for	that	too.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">contents	of	the	two	boxes	had	me	convinced	that	their	owners	had	not	survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	rumble	interrupted	my	dark	thoughts.	“Was	that	thunder?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	looked	at	me.	Her	icy	blue	eyes	had	dulled	in	the	last	several	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head,	the	movement	almost	unnoticeable.	She	closed	her	eyes	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	the	slight	motion	made	her	dizzy.	“His	t-truck,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>I	 got	 up	 from	 my	 chair	 but	 had	 to	 sit	 back	 down	 again	 as	 the	 quick movement	made	my	head	spin.	After	a	moment,	I	rose	again,	and	made	my	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	toward	the	cabinet,	dragging	my	chair	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	n-need	the	t-table?”	Beth's	monotone	voice	called	after	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	just	the	key.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 the	 cabinet	 doors	 were	 open,	 I	 pulled	 boxes	 out	 and	 threw	 them	 on	 the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-what're	you	d-doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 stood	 behind	 me	 with	 her	 arms	 crossed.	 She	 tapped	 her	 bare	 foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boxes	 surrounded	 her.	 Some	 tipped	 over	 on	 their	 sides	 with	 their	 lids	 lifted,	 a few	had	their	contents	spilled	out	on	the	floor,	while	others	remained	sealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	going	through	these.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	of	th-them?”	She	sounded	surprised	but	also	a	little	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	all	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 sat	 on	 the	 floor	 and	 searched	 the	 boxes,	 careful	 to	 return	 the	 contents when	 we'd	 finished.	 We	 were	 surprised	 that	 many	 held	 the	 same	 things.	 From drawings	and	toys	to	rocks	and	feathers,	few	had	anything	of	importance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-what	are	we	l-looking	for?”	Beth	said	as	she	repacked	another	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“I	don't	know.	Something	we	can	use,	like	the	nail	file.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.”	Bethany	grabbed	another	box	from	the	few	we	had	yet	to	check. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	this?”	She	held	up	a	piece	of	wire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	maybe,	put	it	here.”	I	had	a	small	assortment	of	items	I	thought	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	useful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	finished,	we	had	twenty-nine	boxes	stacked	up	around	us.	A	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">collection	of	handy	items,	two	pieces	of	wire,	a	pen,	some	string,	and	a	smaller</p>
<p class="calibre1">nail	file,	piled	between	the	mats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	forgot	that	shelf.”	Bethany	pointed	behind	me,	and	I	followed	her	finger</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	bottom	of	the	empty	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 small	 shelf	 that	 stretched	 across	 the	 back	 of	 the	 closet	 was	 empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	walked	over	to	the	wardrobe	and	shoved	over	a	bunch	of	clothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	left-hand	side.	In	the	back	was	a	small	corner	shelf	and	on	it	sat	another box	standing	on	its	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shrugged.	“I	th-thought	I	could	s-see	something.”	She	plucked	the	box</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	shelf	and	held	it	out	to	me.	“It's	heavy,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	box	and	turned	it	in	my	hands.	I	looked	over	toward	the	cabinet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	rough	carvings	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>“It's	 his,	 isn't	 it?”	 she	 said,	 pointing	 to	 the	 ID	 on	 the	 box	 and	 the	 one scratched	inside	the	large	wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	placed	the	box	down	on	the	floor	in	front	of	me,	and	we	stared	at	it.	Finally, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	reached	over	and	pulled	off	the	lid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	in	it?”	I	leaned	forward	to	get	a	better	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	reached	inside	and	pulled	out	a	small,	brown	teddy	bear.	I	gasped, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not	expecting	the	stuffed	toy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he's	cute!”	Bethany	gave	the	little	bear	a	cuddle,	before	laying	it	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside	 her.	 Her	 hand	 dipped	 into	 the	 box	 again	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 heavy	 metal object.	“W-what	about	this?”	she	smiled	as	she	held	it	out	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	object	and	turned	it	over.	My	head	swivelled	back	in	the	direction</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	cabinet.	“This	is	what	he	used,	I'm	sure	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 on	 one	 of	 the	 many	 implements	 and	 out	 sprang	 a	 knife	 blade.	 My fingers	pulled	on	another	part,	and	a	small	file	popped	out	from	the	other	side.	I tugged	again	on	another	section;	a	corkscrew	sprang	forth.	A	smile	crept	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	face	as	my	hands	pushed	the	pieces	back	into	place.	“Now	this	is	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	can	use.”	I	placed	the	pearl-handled,	pocket	knife	inside	my	remaining	dress</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket.	My	fingers	made	sure	the	button	was	still	resting	in	the	corner	before	my hand	withdrew.	“Anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	tipped	the	box	upside	down,	and	a	small	feather	drifted	out.	“Nope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 better	 put	 everything	 back.”	 I	 stood	 up,	 feeling	 the	 weight	 of	 the	 new tool	in	my	pocket	and	began	returning	boxes	to	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 wasn't	 long	 before	 we	 had	 everything	 tucked	 inside	 the	 wardrobe,	 and	 I had	 the	 lock	 back	 in	 place.	 Back	 on	 my	 mat,	 I	 slipped	 the	 objects	 we'd	 found underneath,	 except	 for	 the	 knife.	 The	 new	 tool	 had	 given	 me	 new	 hope,	 and	 I was	 set	 to	 start	 working	 on	 the	 window	 again.	 I	 stood	 to	 begin	 my	 work	 when the	door	to	our	room	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stood	 in	 the	 doorway;	 his	 hands	 rested	 on	 either	 side	 of	 the	 doorjamb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 head,	 with	 its	 thick	 mass	 of	 dark	 brown	 hair,	 hung	 down.	 His	 rounded shoulders	 rose	 and	 fell	 with	 each	 weary	 breath.	 I	 stared	 at	 him	 with	 my	 mouth wide	open,	unable	to	speak	or	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 few	 moments,	 he	 painstakingly	 lifted	 his	 head.	 His	 familiar	 brown eyes	 bored	 into	 my	 blue	 ones.	 He	 no	 longer	 wore	 the	 mask	 that	 had	 once concealed	 his	 face.	 His	 golden-brown	 skin	 had	 taken	 on	 more	 of	 an	 ash	 grey tone.	The	royal	blue	t-shirt	he	wore	was	wet	in	spots	with	his	sweat.	He	removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 hand	 from	 the	 doorjamb	 and	 wiped	 the	 back	 of	 it	 across	 his	 forehead.	 He took	an	unsteady	step	forward	and	stopped;	he	grabbed	onto	the	doorjamb	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jasper!”	 I	 called,	 finally	 finding	 my	 voice.	 Beth	 and	 I	 moved	 toward	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	His	voice	cracked,	and	he	held	up	his	one	hand,	while	the	other	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door	shut	behind	him.	“I	can	walk	on	my	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	and	I	stayed	on	either	side	of	him.	We	led	him	toward	the	table	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 sat	 down	 on	 one	 of	 the	 chairs.	 Beth	 grabbed	 one	 of	 a	 few	 remaining	 water bottles	 and	 set	 it	 down	 in	 front	 of	 him.	 He	 looked	 up	 at	 her	 and	 smiled	 before turning	 his	 attention	 back	 to	 me.	 I	 sat	 in	 the	 other	 chair	 across	 from	 him,	 and Beth	sat	down	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	thought	you	were	–”	I	stopped	myself	as	I	tried	to	find	the	appropriate</p>
<p class="calibre1">word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dead,”	Beth	blurted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glared	a	warning	at	Beth.	She	rolled	her	eyes	and	shrugged.	“We	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	were	too	sick	to	visit,”	I	said	correcting	my	sister's	blunt	statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	dead,”	Jasper	paused,	“not	yet,”	he	finished.	He	took	a	deep	breath</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	wheezed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	taking	care	of	you?”	I	reached	over	and	placed	my	hand	on	top	of	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 hot	 hand	 tensed,	 and	 I	 thought	 he	 was	 about	 to	 withdraw	 it,	 but	 then	 he relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?”	His	soft	brown	eyes	narrowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cecil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha,”	he	let	out	a	choked	laugh.	“Well,	he	does	occasionally	bring	me	food</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	water,	but	that	is	about	all.”	Jasper	closed	his	eyes	as	though	the	words	he'd spoken	had	drained	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	does	he	g-go?”	Beth	questioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	gaze	shifted	from	my	sister	and	fell	back	on	Jasper.	I	was	curious	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	too	and	waited	for	his	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper	 inhaled,	 his	 lungs	 rattled,	 and	 his	 throat	 whined	 as	 the	 air	 passed through.	“To	find	others.	To	look	for	food	-	secrets.”	He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	widened.	“Others?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	who	escaped	that	night.”	Jasper	reached	for	the	bottle	of	water	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 shaky	 hand,	 while	 the	 other	 tried	 to	 turn	 the	 lid.	 After	 a	 second,	 I	 reached over	 and	 unscrewed	 it	 for	 him.	 His	 mouth	 twitched	 as	 though	 trying	 to	 smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	that	night?”	I	squeezed	his	hand	gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	what	happened?”	Beth	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glared	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	She	shrugged	and	glared	back.	Had	her	icy	blue	eyes	not	dulled	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	few	days,	it	would	have	appeared	more	intimidating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	to	Jasper	and	once	again	waited	for	his	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>“There	was	a	fire	in	the	forest…simulation	room,”	he	wheezed	as	a	sudden fit	of	coughing	shook	his	body.	When	he	finished,	he	wiped	his	mouth	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottom	of	his	t-shirt.	“Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	He	had	no	reason	to	apologize. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	it	start?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	me.”	He	looked	down	at	the	table.	“It	had	to	end;	I	needed	to	save</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	–	from	him.”	He	closed	his	eyes	again.	“I	must	go.”	Jasper	moved	as	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	stand	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!”	 I	 squeezed	 his	 hand.	 Jasper's	 body	 relaxed	 in	 the	 chair,	 and	 he wheezed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	different	vaccines?	Why	boosters?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shook	 his	 head.	 “With	 each	 new	 vaccine,	 we	 had	 to	 give	 a	 booster	 or several.	 Some	 vaccines	 were	 given	 in	 small	 doses	 over	 the	 course	 of	 a	 few days.”	 He	 took	 another	 deep	 rattled	 breath.	 “They	 were	 constantly	 trying	 new ones.	 When	 one	 did	 not	 work	 they	 would	 create	 another,	 which	 you	 and	 the others	would	then	receive.”	Jasper	bent	his	head	and	rested	his	chin	on	his	chest as	though	he'd	fallen	asleep.	I	gave	a	gentle	shake	to	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	they	know	it	didn't	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	how	–	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!”	I	interrupted	Beth	from	her	echoed	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	tested.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	narrowed.	“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper's	 shoulders	 slouched	 more.	 “They	 would	 bring	 some	 of	 the	 less</p>
<p class="calibre1">promising	children	here.	Let	them	play	outside,	expose	them	to	the	mosquitos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Mosquitos? </i>	The	word	was	familiar,	but	I	couldn't	remember	what	it	meant.	I was	about	to	ask	when	another	thought	interrupted,	and	I	glanced	at	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pictured	 the	 clothing	 hanging	 inside.	 “What	 happened?”	 I	 stared	 at	 Jasper's closed	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 died	 –	 all	 of	 them.	 With	 each	 death	 came	 a	 new	 vaccine.”	 His	 eyes popped	open,	but	they	did	not	look	at	me.	They	stared	off	into	some	distant	place or	memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every	s-single	one?”	Beth's	quiet	voice	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper	nodded.	“All	but	one,	with	the	last	vaccine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?”	My	voice	squeaked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper	 shook	 his	 head	 and	 stared	 at	 me.	 “He	 may	 have	 died.	 We	 do	 not know.	He	escaped.	He	got	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When?”	 My	 mind	 flashed	 to	 the	 carving	 inside	 the	 cabinet.	 I	 pressed	 my lips	together.	I	wanted	to	tell	Jasper	about	what	we'd	found,	but	I	couldn't	take the	chance	that	Cecil	would	somehow	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>Jasper	rubbed	his	chin	and	took	a	moment	before	he	answered.	“A	couple	of weeks,	 maybe	 even	 a	 month,	 before	 I	 brought	 you	 here.”	 He	 pushed	 his	 chair back.	 “He	 will	 be	 back	 soon.	 I	 must	 go.”	 Jasper	 rose	 in	 slow	 motion	 from	 his chair,	and	I	didn't	stop	him.	Beth	jumped	to	her	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!	Is	he	sick?	Is	Cecil	sick?	He's	always	coughing,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“No,	allergies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	all	this?”	I	folded	my	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper	sighed.	“Because	I	worked	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	for	him,”	I	corrected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	meant	with.	I	was	part	of	his	team	until	I	found	out	he	wanted	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	just	save	the	world	–	he	wanted	to	run	it.	When	I	disagreed	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">methods,	 I	 suddenly	 went	 from	 being	 on	 top	 to	 becoming	 your	 nurse.”	 Jasper turned	and	walked	toward	the	door.	Beth	and	I	remained	by	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	were	you	my	nurse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper	 shrugged.	 “Only	 about	 the	 last	 two	 years,	 when	 Cecil…”	 he	 paused for	 a	 moment	 as	 if	 to	 search	 for	 the	 right	 words.	 “He	 decided	 I	 couldn't	 be trusted	 with	 his	 plan.	 It	 was	 at	 the	 same	 time	 when	 everything	 changed	 and humanity	really	was	in	great	peril.	The	first	three	years	at	C.E.C.I.L	was	merely planning	 and	 preparation.	 We	 built	 our	 supply	 stores	 so	 that	 we	 could	 become self-sufficient	while	we	worked	on	a	solution.”	He	inhaled	and	closed	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	the	time	the	world	was	sick.	C.E.C.I.L	was	sustainable.	It	was	its	own	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	 within	 another.”	 Jasper	 leaned	 back	 against	 the	 door	 and	 rested.	 His breaths	were	short	and	wheezy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 for	 a	 moment	 as	 his	 words	 sunk	 in,	 things	 like	 food supplies	finally	made	sense.	“He's	not	letting	us	out,	is	he?”	I	said,	speaking	my thoughts	and	worries	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper	turned	around.	“If	I	find	a	way	before	it	is	too	late,	I	will	let	you	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	us	go	now!”	My	heart	pounded	with	my	words	as	my	feet	carried	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer	to	Jasper;	Beth	followed	along	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 cannot.	 You	 will	 not	 stand	 a	 chance.	 He	 will	 have	 you	 before	 you	 even have	an	opportunity	to	hide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will	not	st-stand	a	chance	in	here,”	Beth	spoke	through	clenched	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hands	balled	into	fists	at	her	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“Step	back…please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 reached	 out	 and	 grabbed	 Beth's	 arm	 pulling	 her	 back	 with	 me.	 My	 gaze fixed	 on	 Jasper's	 eyes	 for	 a	 moment	 before	 he	 turned	 and	 faced	 the	 door.	 He reached	 into	 his	 pocket,	 pulled	 something	 out	 and	 in	 seconds	 pushed	 the	 door open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	Beth	yelled.	I	grabbed	her	arm	as	she	moved	toward	him,	but	my	grip</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>slipped.	She	reached	the	door	as	it	closed	behind	him.	Beth	pounded	the	hidden entrance	 with	 her	 fists.	 “Let.	 Us.	 Out!”	 she	 yelled.	 After	 a	 moment,	 she	 turned around,	red	faced.	“We	could	have	g-grabbed	him	and	p-pushed	him	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way.	 We	 c-could	 have	 been	 out.	 W-why	 did	 you	 s-stop	 m-me?”	 She	 wiped	 her eyes	with	her	hands	before	any	liquid	could	spill	down	her	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 at	 her,	 unable	 to	 answer	 her	 question.	 We	 could	 have	 gotten	 out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 in	 our	 weakened	 state,	 together	 we	 were	 stronger	 than	 Jasper.	 But	 I couldn't	do	that	to	him.	I	shook	my	head.	The	distant	rumble	of	his	truck	touched my	ears.	“Jasper	was	right.	He	would	have	caught	us.”	I	turned	and	grabbed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-what're	you	doing?”	Beth's	quivering	voice	asked	from	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	and	looked	at	my	sister	leaning	against	the	door.	“I'm	going	to	work</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 window;	 you	 keep	 an	 ear	 to	 the	 door.	 If	 you	 hear	 him,	 let	 me	 know.”	 I managed	 a	 weak	 smile.	 Working	 on	 the	 window	 was	 the	 least	 I	 could	 do;	 I'd already	ruined	our	first	real	chance	of	escape. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“April,”	Bethany's	voice	whispered	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	he'll	come	t-tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	he'll	c-come	into	the	room	t-tonight? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	at	her	words.	The	darkness	of	the	room	made	my	eyes	feel	like	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	still	closed,	and	I	blinked	to	be	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 mean	 Cecil?	 Why	 would	 he	 come	 tonight?”	 My	 voice	 shook	 a	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	Bethany	shuffling	told	me	that	she	too	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	m-mean	do	you	think	he'll	s-sneak	in	and	l-leave	s-stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	Beth,	go	to	sleep.”	I	lay	back	down	on	my	mat	and	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	with	the	sheet.	It	was	a	warm	night,	and	the	sheet	wasn't	necessary,	but	it comforted	me	and	made	me	feel	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 muscles	 relaxed	 one	 by	 one	 as	 thoughts	 and	 images	 disappeared	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	Her	voice	started	me	awake</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	th-think	Jasper	will	help	somehow?	I	mean,	if	he	c-can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 question	 took	 me	 by	 surprise.	 I	 didn't	 answer	 right	 away;	 instead,	 I rolled	away	from	her	and	faced	the	door.	“Yes…if	he	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	though	he	t-told	us	he	works	with	him?”	Her	hand	rested	on	my	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Used	to.	Now	go	to	sleep,	Bethany,”	I	whispered;	questions	and	uncertainty</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolled	through	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	rustling	woke	me.	My	heart	skipped	and	then	sped	up.	Under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	of	the	sheet,	my	fingers	searched	the	underside	of	the	mat	for	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hidden	tools.	Panic	rose	as	I	felt	only	the	rough	wood	floor	beneath	my	mat.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleepy	confusion	cleared,	and	I	remembered	I	faced	the	door	and	not	Beth.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">tools	hid	under	the	edge	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	peeked	through	a	half-open	eyelid	and	saw	an	out	of	focus	figure	near	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table.	I	rubbed	away	the	blurriness.	Bethany's	seated	form	came	into	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	My	morning	voice	sounded	scratchier	than	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“F-food.”	She	did	not	look	my	way	but	continued	rummaging	through	cloth</p>
<p class="calibre1">bags	on	the	table	in	front	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>Beth	 glanced	 away	 from	 the	 bag	 she	 was	 looking	 in.	 “He	 b-brought	 us	 f-food.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 jumped	 up.	 The	 combination	 of	 my	 quick	 movement	 and	 hunger	 brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	back	down	hard.	The	thin	mat	offered	little	protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	slow	and	cautious	steps	finally	brought	me	to	the	table.	“Let	me	see.”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached	for	the	bag	in	Beth's	hands,	but	she	snatched	it	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	she	said,	before	handing	the	bag	back	to	me.	“I'm	j-just	hungry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	into	the	sack	and	pulled	out	cans	of	food;	peaches,	orange	slices, </p>
<p class="calibre1">beans,	tomatoes.	“Did	he	leave	anything	to	open	these	with?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 m-mean	 this.”	 She	 held	 out	 a	 well-rusted	 can	 opener	 before	 laying	 it down	on	the	table.	It	didn't	look	like	it	would	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	 in	 the	 other	 two	 bags?”	 I	 pointed	 with	 my	 chin	 as	 I	 pulled	 them toward	me	and	opened	them	up.	My	eyes	answered	my	question	for	me;	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	of	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 also	 left	 a	 jug	 of	 w-water.”	 Beth	 heaved	 a	 large	 plastic	 bottle	 off	 the floor	and	set	it	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	new	delivery	of	food,	Beth	wasn't	her	usual	excited	self	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gifts.	 Her	 voice	 was	 flat,	 and	 she	 showed	 no	 emotion	 as	 she	 stared	 at	 the	 bags and	their	contents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	the	matter?”	I	said,	looking	at	the	dark	circles	under	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	chin	quivered.	“I	w-want	t-to	g-go	home,”	she	stammered.	She	pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	lips	together.	Her	face	tinged	pink	and	she	wiped	at	her	eyes.	In	almost	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	instant	she	pulled	her	shoulders	back,	sniffed,	and	cleared	her	throat.	Apart from	her	still	glistening	eyes,	all	signs	of	her	sudden	emotion	disintegrated.	In	all the	days	and	weeks	we'd	been	there,	Beth	had	never	mentioned	going	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	mean	C.E.C.I.L?	You	heard	Jasper	say	it	burned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 shook	 her	 head.	 “N-no,	 home-home	 –	 I	 remember	 stuff,	 n-not</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything,	but	some.	I	want	to	g-get	out	and	go	h-home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 reached	 out	 and	 wrapped	 my	 arms	 around	 her;	 her	 smaller	 body	 nestled against	 me.	 I	 kissed	 the	 top	 of	 her	 head.	 The	 smell	 of	 his	 cologne	 burned	 my nose,	causing	me	to	pull	away	and	gag.	I	held	onto	Beth's	shoulders	keeping	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	arm's	length. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bethany,	did…did	he	come	near	you?”	My	voice	wavered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wrinkled	her	brow	and	shook	her	head.	“N-no.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?”	I	stared	into	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	She	looked	at	me.	“W-why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	your	hair	smells	like	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Beth	grabbed	a	lock	of	her	hair,	brought	it	toward	her	and	sniffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	nose	wrinkled.	“Eww!	Why?”	She	dropped	her	hair	and	stared	at	me	wide-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>eyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn't	see	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	looked	at	me,	a	puzzled	look	in	her	eyes.	“N-no.	I	was	asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	over	to	our	mats	and	got	down	on	my	hands	and	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 are	 you	 looking	 for?”	 Beth	 stood	 above	 me	 with	 her	 hands	 on	 her hips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 back	 on	 my	 knees	 and	 shook	 my	 head.	 “I	 don't	 know	 -	 a	 reason	 your hair	smells	like	him?”	My	response	came	out	sounding	a	little	more	irritated	than I	expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shrugged	and	ignored	my	tone.	“Forget	it;	he's	trying	to	s-scare	us.	C-</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	we	eat	n-now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pressed	my	lips	together.	I	didn't	trust	Cecil,	and	I	was	sure	he	was	capable</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	anything.	He'd	already	proven	that	tormenting	was	one	of	his	favourite	games. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	 been	 right	 about	 the	 can	 opener;	 it	 was	 useless.	 However,	 the	 pocket	 knife had	the	tool	we	needed,	and	we	were	successful	at	opening	a	couple	of	cans.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled	our	growling	stomachs	before	returning	to	our	mats	for	a	nap.	Awhile	later, the	drumming	of	rain	and	the	rumbling	of	Cecil's	truck	woke	us.	He	was	leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	 searching	 for	 others	 we	 hoped	 he	 wouldn't	 find.	 With	 renewed	 strength, we	hurried	to	work	on	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 it's	 loosening,”	 I	 called	 down	 to	 her	 as	 I	 jabbed	 the	 knife	 into	 the rubbery	seal	and	picked	out	a	large	chunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 gave	 the	 thumbs-up,	 her	 face	 brighter	 since	 having	 eaten.	 “Do	 you think	 J-Jasper	 will	 be	 back?”	 She	 said	 turning	 her	 head	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 the invisible	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't.	Think.	So.”	I	grunted	as	I	jabbed	the	knife	in	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	w-was	just	hoping	m-maybe…”	her	voice	trailed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	back	on	my	knees	and	wiped	the	sweat	from	my	forehead.	“We	won't</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	him	again.”	I	swallowed	down	the	sudden	tightness	in	my	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.”	Beth's	voice	was	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	forward	and	picked	away	at	the	window	again,	resolute	in	my	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	focus	drove	Jasper	from	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	you	get	all	that	s-stuff	out,	what	are	you	going	to	d-do?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	startled	me	a	bit,	and	my	heart	skipped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	up	at	the	sky.	“Remove	the	window.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 loud,	 frustrating	 sigh	 escaped	 from	 my	 lips.	 My	 plan	 hadn't	 extended beyond	 removing	 the	 window.	 “I	 think	 that's	 enough	 for	 today.	 He'll	 be	 back soon.”	I	folded	the	knife	and	put	it	in	my	pocket	before	climbing	down	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>cabinet.	Beth	followed	behind	me	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	returned	the	table	and	chair,	grabbed	a	couple	of	books	from	our	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">collection,	and	settled	on	our	mats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	my	book	to	where	I'd	left	off	days	ago,	but	Beth's	questions	and	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	wouldn't	leave	me	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	right,  <i class="calibre3">what	do	we	do	once	we	get	the	window	out?	How	much	time</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">would	we	have	to	get	out	and	climb	down	to	the	roof	before	he	came	back?	And</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">then	where	do	we	go? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	only	given	a	passing	thought	to	those	same	questions	when	I	first	got	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea	to	escape.	But	now	I	realized	those	questions	needed	answering	before	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	 any	 further.	 There	 was	 no	 point	 in	 working	 at	 that	 window	 until	 the	 plan was	solid. </p>

<p class="calibre1">room	was	hot	and	the	air	thick	as	I	gasped	for	air.	My	ears	tuned	in	to	Bethany's slow	 and	 even	 breaths.	 I	 focused	 on	 the	 sound	 and	 matched	 each	 inhale	 and exhale,	it	calmed	me,	and	soon	my	breathing	slowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 room	 was	 brighter	 than	 usual,	 and	 at	 first,	 I	 thought	 it	 was	 morning.	 I soon	understood	it	was	a	different	kind	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rose	from	my	mat,	eased	the	table,	then	the	chair,	over	to	the	cabinet	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed	on	top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 cross-legged;	 my	 elbow	 rested	 on	 one	 knee,	 and	 I	 cradled	 my	 chin	 in my	palm	as	I	stared	out	the	window.	A	full	moon	hovered	above	the	trees	and	lit</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	the	sky.	It	looked	as	though	it	were	smiling	down	at	me	and	seemed	so	close; </p>
<p class="calibre1">like	I	could	almost	touch	it	if	no	barrier	stood	in	my	way.	But	I	knew	it	was	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	away	–	an	unimaginable	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 my	 eyes	 adjusted	 to	 the	 moonlight,	 it	 appeared	 that	 there	 was	 about	 as much	to	see	at	night	as	there	was	during	the	day.	Small	black	shapes	dipped	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dove	through	the	air,	and	I	understood	at	once	that	they	were	bats	catching	their dinner.	 Miniature	 lights	 flashed	 in	 the	 shadows	 of	 the	 trees.	 I	 knew	 they	 were insects,	but	the	 name	for	the	 tiny	luminous	creatures	 escaped	me.  <i class="calibre3">Fireflies, </i>	 the word	popped	into	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hoo,	hoo! </i>	The	faint	and	strange	call	caught	my	attention,	and	I	leaned	closer to	the	window.	No	matter	how	hard	I	tried,	I	could	not	imagine	what	made	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise.	I	shuddered	at	the	eerie	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 woods,	 eyes	 glowed	 as	 the	 moonlight	 reflected	 off	 of them.	Shadows	of	four-legged	creatures	crawled	amid	the	trees.	The	night	was	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive	as	the	day,	not	everything	slept.	We	would	not	leave	at	night;	I	shook	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing	up	there?	April,	w-wake	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	my	eyes	and	found	I	was	staring	at	a	wall,	curled	up	in	a	tight	ball	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	fallen	asleep	on	the	top	of	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	 up,	 I	 stretched	 and	 peered	 out	 the	 window.	 It	 was	 quiet	 outside, sometime	between	when	the	creatures	of	the	night	go	to	sleep	and	those	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	begin	to	wake.  <i class="calibre3">Would	this	be	the	right	time	of	day	to	break	out? </i>	No	sooner did	 the	 thought	 occur	 to	 me	 that	 in	 the	 same	 instant	 I	 realized	 it	 would	 not	 be possible.	 Cecil	 would	 still	 be	 here,	 no	 doubt	 asleep,	 but	 still	 here.	 Our	 escape would	have	to	happen	when	he	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	we	have	paper?”	I	asked	Beth	as	I	climbed	down	from	the	cabinet.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 at	 me	 with	 a	 confused	 look	 on	 her	 face.	 “I	 need	 to	 make	 notes,”	 I explained.	I	took	the	chair	off	the	table	and	carried	it	over	to	its	usual	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	rummaged	through	one	of	the	boxes,	and	I	sat	down	in	my	chair.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 few	 seconds,	 she	 found	 what	 she	 was	 looking	 for	 and	 approached	 the	 table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pulled	 out	 the	 other	 chair	 across	 from	 me	 and	 sat	 down	 handing	 me	 a crumpled	piece	of	paper	and	a	green	crayon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.”	I	began	to	write. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	you	d-doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Writing	out	a	list.”	I	kept	my	eyes	focused	on	the	paper	as	I	thought	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	recent	observations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	list?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	we	need	to	do	to	get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See,”	I	explained.	“Number	one,	we	leave	when	he	goes	searching	–	once</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	have	the	window	loose	that	is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	A	hint	of	sarcasm	tinged	her	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	my	eyes	and	continued.	“Number	two,	it	won't	be	at	night,	even	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaves	at	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	it's	dark	and	who	knows	what's	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“F-fine.	What	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 me.	 Other	 than	 what	 I'd	 written	 down,	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 more information	we	needed	to	execute	our	escape.	My	list	had	only	two	items,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	silly.	Then	I	thought	of	something	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	know	how	long	we	have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	scrunched	her	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	time	between	when	he	leaves	and	when	he	comes	back.	We	don't	want</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>to	get	caught.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shrugged.	“How?	It's	not	like	we	have	a…”	she	paused,	“a	clock.”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">waved	her	hand	around	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	have	to	count.”	I	wrote	down	number	three. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha!	YOU	can	count.”	Beth	folded	her	arms	and	rocked	back	a	little	in	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	you're	going	to	fall	over	tipping	your	chair	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pfft!	You	s-sound	like	mom!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dropped	my	crayon	and	stared	at	Beth.	“What	did	you	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said,	you	sound	like…”	Her	eyes	grew	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	remembered	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 nodded.	 “Mom,	 she	 didn't	 like	 it	 when	 I	 leaned	 b-back	 in	 my	 chair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sat	forward;	the	chair's	front	feet	clunked	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shook	her	head.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will.	It	took	me	awhile.	There's	still	a	lot	I	don't	remember.”	I	folded</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	my	list	and	placed	it	in	my	pocket	with	the	hope	that	I	would	have	more	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">add	to	it	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">We	 grew	 bored	 and	 anxious.	 It	 had	 been	 days	 since	 Cecil	 had	 left	 in	 his	 truck, and	 he	 made	 a	 habit	 of	 surprising	 us	 with	 visits	 instead.	 Sometimes	 he	 would poke	his	head	in	through	the	door,	say	nothing,	and	leave.	Other	times	he	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	comfortable	on	the	cot	we	weren't	using;	he'd	stay	for	minutes	or	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	if	he	popped	by	in	the	morning,	it	didn't	mean	he	wasn't	coming	back	later</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 day.	 The	 lack	 of	 consistency	 kept	 us	 from	 working	 on	 our	 escape	 plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	that,	we	had	nothing	left	to	do	but	read	and	re-read	our	books.	Despite</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	boredom,	the	decorated	shoeboxes	remained	untouched.	We	had	no	intention</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	doing	what	he'd	asked	even	when	he	checked	the	boxes	whenever	he	stepped</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	small	cartons	were	still	up	against	the	wall	where	I'd	kicked	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	placing	anything	inside	would	be	a	clear	sign	that	we'd	given	up	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope	of	escaping.	For	the	moment	it	was	still	our	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	s-search	the	cabinet	again,”	Beth	suggested	early	one	morning	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	were	eating	our	small	breakfast.	After	the	first	initial	canned	meal,	we	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">eating	 much	 smaller	 portions	 from	 the	 tins.	 We	 never	 knew	 if	 or	 when	 Cecil would	bring	us	any	more	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	 I	 shook	 my	 head.	 “Besides,	 he	 could	 walk	 through	 that	 door	 at	 any time.”	There	was	no	way	we	were	opening	that	cabinet	again;	there	were	far	too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>many	ghosts	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wasn't	here	yesterday,	and	the	d-day	before	that,	only	once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 finished	 eating	 in	 silence	 then	 returned	 to	 our	 mats.	 I	 lay	 down	 on	 my back	and	stared	at	the	rafters.	Every	detail	of	the	wood	beams	was	so	ingrained</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	memory	that	I	could	draw	our	prison	with	my	eyes	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can	play	a	g-game,”	Beth	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	exhaled	loudly.	“I've	got	to	go.”	She	rose	to	her	feet.	The	floorboards</p>
<p class="calibre1">underneath	me	squeaked	a	little	with	her	sudden	movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	the	lid	back	on,	you	forgot	last	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We'd	discovered	that	on	one	of	Cecil's	middle-of-the-night	visits,	he'd	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	one	of	our	two	buckets.	He	had	also	not	replenished	our	diminishing	box</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	tissues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	my	eyebrows	as	Bethany	returned	to	her	mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	caught	my	questioning	look.	“Yes,	I	did.”	She	rolled	her	eyes.	“Can	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">play	a	g-game?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed.	“What	game?	I	don't	know	any.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	'What	if'	game,”	Beth	said.	“That	was	always	a	good	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	memory?”	I	closed	my	eyes	trying	to	recall	the	game	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	so.	It	sort	of	popped	into	my	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	suppose	you	remember	how	it's	played?”	I	reached	up	and	scratched</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	head.	My	hair	hadn't	met	water	or	shampoo	in	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 room	 fell	 silent	 for	 a	 moment	 except	 for	 Beth's	 occasional	 whisper	 to herself.	“I	got	it!	I'll	start!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn't	it	help	if	I	knew	the	rules?”	I	pressed	my	lips	together	somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1">annoyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You'll	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.”	I	opened	my	eyes	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if….”	Bethany	paused,	“What	if	you	had	p-purple	hair?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Purple	hair?”	I	pressed	my	fingertips	to	my	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Answer	the	question.”	She	was	serious	about	her	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 thought	 about	 my	 answer,	 and	 as	 I	 did,	 the	 faint	 memory	 of	 the	 game peaked	out	from	the	crevices	in	my	brain.	“I'd	wear	a	hat	so	my	head	wouldn't	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistaken	 for	 a	 grape.”	 I	 rolled	 my	 head	 to	 the	 side	 and	 looked	 at	 Beth.	 “Good enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	surprising.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	it	supposed	to	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	the	p-point.	Anyway,	your	turn.”	She	looked	at	me;	her	folded	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>rested	on	her	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	back	up	at	the	rafters.	“What	if	we	run	out	of	tissue?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	use	the	pages	from	our	books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 would?”	 Her	 answer	 surprised	 me,	 and	 I	 rolled	 over	 onto	 my	 side.	 I bent	my	arm	and	tucked	it	under	my	head;	a	moment	later	Beth	rolled	over	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">faced	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya,	I	would.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	love	those	books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	“I	like	having	a	clean	and	dry	butt	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed	and	rolled	back	onto	my	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	your	turn,	Beth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sighed.	“What	if…	we	don't	g-get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	w-what	if	–	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We.	Will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April	–	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cut	her	short	again	and	sat	up.	“Sh!	I	hear	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	thunder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 it's	 his	 truck.”	 I	 jumped	 up	 and	 grabbed	 the	 table,	 and	 Bethany</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	behind	me	with	the	chair.	Once	they	were	in	place,	I	scrambled	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	of	the	cabinet	and	pressed	my	cheek	against	the	window.	The	red	tail	lights</p>
<p class="calibre1">glowed	in	the	shadows	of	the	trees.	He	was	leaving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One,	two,	three…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty-Seven	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Tread	Carefully</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 on	 top	 of	 the	 cabinet,	 picking	 at	 the	 window	 and	 counting.	 It	 was	 much harder	than	I	thought.	Several	times	a	loss	of	focus	caused	me	to	forget	where	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	and	I	started	over.	The	task	was	proving	difficult,	and	then	I	noticed	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	lightened	since	he'd	left,	though	the	sun	had	yet	to	peek	over	the	treetops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	moment	I	remembered	how	its	position	could	measure	time.	I	shook	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head,	wishing	I	would	have	thought	of	the	sun	sooner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 climbed	 down	 from	 the	 wardrobe,	 annoyed	 by	 my	 stupidity.	 “That	 was	 a waste	of	time.”	I	plunked	down	on	my	mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	looked	up	from	her	book.	“Is	he	back?	That	was	f-fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“Counting	–	all	I	had	to	do	was	notice	the	position	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun.	Stupid,”	I	called	myself	under	my	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	put	down	her	reading	material.	“No,	not	s-stupid,	still	waking	up.”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiled.	“Our	brains	aren't	there	yet.”	She	tapped	on	her	head	with	her	finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	you	d-do.	Why	else	have	w-we	been	so…”	She	waved	her	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	dismissed	her	thought.	“Anyway,	you	weren't	up	there	too	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	 we	 finally	 heard	 the	 rumble	 of	 his	 truck,	 I	 climbed	 back	 up	 onto	 the cabinet	and	took	note	that	the	sun	was	high	in	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scrambled	back	down,	and	with	Bethany's	help,	returned	the	table	and	chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	their	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	at	the	table,	I	filled	in	list	item	number	three,	though	it	would	require further	observation.	But	for	the	moment	and	from	what	I	remembered	from	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	 trips,	 it	 seemed	 that	 Cecil	 most	 often	 left	 at	 dawn.	 He	 returned	 much later	when	the	sun	was	high	overhead.  <i class="calibre3">Would	that	be	enough	time? </i>	I	tapped	my fingers	on	my	forehead.	It	would	have	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 at	 the	 strategy	 that	 was	 beginning	 to	 take	 shape;	 the	 only	 question left	was	–	 <i class="calibre3">where	do	we	go? </i>	I'd	read	enough	stories	to	know	that	heading	into	the forest	 was	 not	 a	 good	 idea.	 We	 would	 have	 to	 follow	 the	 road.	 Though	 the thought	 of	 walking	 down	 a	 road	 was	 scary	 too,  <i class="calibre3">what	 if	 we	 met	 someone	 that</i> <i class="calibre3">wasn't	about	to	help? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 folded	 up	 my	 list.	 Until	 the	 way	 out	 was	 clear,	 there	 was	 no	 point	 in planning	 anything	 further.	 I	 joined	 Beth	 on	 the	 mats	 and	 tucked	 the	 list underneath	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?”	she	said,	closing	her	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	questioned	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>“When	are	w-we	leaving?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“When	we	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	work	on	it	some	more	today?”	Beth's	voice	was	hopeful</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	pointed	at	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	He's	still	here.	We'll	have	to	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	him	to	l-leave	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	I	shook	my	head.	“I'm	going	to	have	to	do	it	at	night.	The	next	time	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaves	might	be	our	only	chance	to	escape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 out	 all	 the	 tools	 from	 underneath	 my	 mat	 and	 the	 knife	 from	 my pocket	and	laid	them	on	the	floor.	I	inspected	each	item.	I	was	going	to	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	serious	digging	out	the	window,	and	only	the	best	tools	would	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	squeaking,	no	sound	of	his	footsteps	outside	the	door,	nothing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">warn	us.	One	look	at	Beth's	face	and	I	knew	that	Cecil	had	entered	the	room	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 standing	 somewhere	 behind	 me.	 I	 slid	 the	 tools	 under	 my	 mat,	 praying	 he wasn't	close	enough	to	see	the	small	pile	of	objects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 hello,	 girls,	 what	 are	 you	 two	 up	 to	 today?”	 his	 raspy	 voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">questioned	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	jumped	up,	covering	one	of	the	tools	with	her	foot	as	she	did.	It	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket	 knife,	 with	 one	 of	 its	 implements	 still	 extended.	 She	 winced,	 but	 she didn't	cry	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	wrong	with	you?”	he	scowled	at	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-nothing,	p-pins	and	needles	from	s-sitting	on	my	f-foot,”	she	said	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany's	 foot	 hadn't	 completely	 covered	 the	 pocket	 knife,	 and	 part	 of	 it stuck	out	from	underneath.	I	sprang	to	my	feet	and	turned	to	face	him,	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	front	of	Bethany	and	hiding	her	injured	foot	and	the	knife	behind	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	about	you?	Pins	and	needles	too?”	He'd	taken	his	grey	eyes	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	and	glared	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph,”	he	snarled	again.	His	eyes	fixed	on	mine,	but	I	refused	to	give	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 pleasure	 of	 looking	 away	 first.	 My	 heart	 raced.	 After	 several	 seconds	 he averted	his	gaze	and	stared	over	the	top	of	my	head.	A	small	grin	of	satisfaction tugged	 at	 the	 corners	 of	 my	 mouth.	 The	 feeling	 was	 brief	 as	 dread	 replaced triumph.	His	gaze	concentrated	on	the	window	behind	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	 now,	 what	 have	 we	 got	 here?”	 He	 walked	 around	 us	 and	 headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>I	held	my	breath	as	I	turned	and	stared	at	his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	 like	 someone	 has	 been	 doing	 some	 cleaning.	 Are	 you	 hoping	 for	 a little	more	daylight?”	He	sneered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	forward	to	put	myself	between	Cecil	and	Bethany.	I	was	still	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	hide	her	injured	foot	and	the	knife	she	covered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	dirty.”	My	cheeks	warmed	as	I	worked	to	keep	my	voice	steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 it	 was…still	 is,	 really.	 I	 can	 fix	 that,”	 he	 whispered	 more	 to	 himself than	to	us.	He	glanced	over	at	the	cot	in	the	corner	of	the	room.	“Still	not	using the	 cot?	 It	 would	 be	 a	 lot	 more	 comfortable	 than	 those,”	 he	 said.	 His	 chin pointed	in	the	direction	of	the	mats	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph.”	He	started	coughing	but	managed	to	gain	control	before	speaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.	 “Well,	 if	 you're	 not	 going	 to	 use	 it…”	 he	 let	 his	 voice	 trail	 off	 as	 he walked	back	toward	the	front	of	the	room.	I	turned	and	once	again	placed	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	position	of	hiding	Beth's	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glared	at	me	for	a	moment	before	focusing	on	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 a	 step	 forward,	 remembering	 the	 cologne	 that	 he	 had	 somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed	to	put	in	her	hair.	“Leave	her	alone.”	My	fists	clenched	at	my	sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 whipped	 his	 head	 in	 my	 direction.	 His	 wide	 eyes	 turned	 to	 narrow	 slits and	 then	 settled	 into	 a	 look	 of	 amusement	 as	 he	 laughed.	 His	 laughter	 evolved into	a	coughing	spasm	that	racked	his	body.	Unable	to	regain	control,	he	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	his	heel	and	walked	out	of	the	room.	The	sound	of	the	lock	was	louder	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	crumpled	to	the	floor,	whimpering	and	grabbing	at	her	injured	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	let	me	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pulled	 her	 hands	 away	 from	 her	 foot,	 and	 I	 lifted	 it	 off	 the	 floor.	 The pocket	 knife	 came	 up	 with	 it.	 She'd	 managed	 to	 step	 on	 the	 point	 of	 the corkscrew	tool.	It	pierced	her	thin	skin	and	hung	from	the	bottom	of	her	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	h-happened?”	Bethany	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tugged	on	the	pocket	knife,	and	the	corkscrew	came	free.	The	injury	wasn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	bad	as	it	looked.	“It's	okay,”	I	said,	“it's	just	a	small	hole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyebrows	shot	up.	“A	h-hole?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	stepped	on	this.”	I	picked	up	the	knife	and	showed	her	the	curly	piece</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	metal.	On	close	inspection,	a	small	drop	of	blood	tinged	the	tip.	“It	went	into your	foot	a	bit,	but	not	too	deep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ew!”	Beth	screwed	up	her	face.	“It	hurts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	 on.”	 I	 left	 Beth	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 returned	 from	 our	 pitiful	 store	 of supplies	 with	 a	 nearly	 empty	 bottle	 of	 water.	 “I	 couldn't	 find	 the	 cloth.”	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>unscrewed	the	lid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Use	a	piece	of	my	d-dress,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	used	the	pocket	knife	to	cut	away	a	small	piece	of	blue	fabric	from	the	hem</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	dress.	I	dampened	it	with	water	and	washed	her	foot.	The	bottom	of	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	dirtier	than	I	thought	as	the	skin	around	the	injury	brightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	s-suppose	he	meant	when	he	said	he	could	fix	that?”	Beth	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	finished	cleaning	her	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fix	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	s-said	he'd	fix	the	dirty	window.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	clean	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	cocked	her	head	to	one	side.	“Do	you	really	th-think	so?”	Her	question</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded	skeptical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	for	a	moment	and	then	shook	my	head.	“No.”	Cecil	wasn't	about	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	our	living	conditions	pleasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty-Eight	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Caught	in	the	Act</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	days	passed.	We	had	no	contact	with	Cecil	or	Jasper,	and	we	did	not	hear	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rumble	of	the	truck.	The	only	sign	that	Cecil,	or	someone,	had	stopped	by	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 four	 days	 after	 Cecil's	 last	 known	 visit.	 We	 had	 woken	 to	 find	 a replenished	 stockpile	 of	 food	 and	 water.	 He'd	 left	 us	 a	 flashlight,	 a	 few	 more books,	and	an	old	board	game,	with	a	mismatch	of	elements	from	various	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">games.	 He'd	 even	 emptied	 our	 waste	 pail	 and	 returned	 the	 second	 one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	he	hadn't	provided	any	more	tissue.	The	shredding	of	books	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	a	possibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	 insisted	 smelling	 Beth's	 hair	 the	 moment	 I	 noticed	 our	 increased	 stores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	been	reluctant,	but	I	persuaded	her.	My	anxiety	eased	when	all	I	smelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	sweat	and	dirt	and	not	the	lingering	scent	of	his	putrid	cologne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	Cecil's	last	visit,	Beth's	foot	healed	with	no	further	issues.	The	pocket</p>
<p class="calibre1">knife	 stayed	 tucked	 under	 my	 mat	 with	 the	 rest	 of	 my	 tools.	 The	 window remained	 untouched.	 I	 had	 been	 too	 afraid	 that	 should	 he	 come	 back	 to	 'fix	 it', he'd	notice	the	missing	bits	of	grey	sealant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	working	on	the	window	today?”	Beth	said.	She	spread	jam	from	a	half-</p>
<p class="calibre1">eaten	jar	on	a	stale	piece	of	bread.	She	had	asked	that	question	every	day	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	time	I'd	worked	on	the	window.	Every	day	I	had	answered	the	same	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	would	sigh	and	shrug	before	moving	on	to	something	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	I	shook	my	head	and	took	a	bite	of	my	pitiful	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C-can	 I?”	 She	 crossed	 her	 arms	 and	 glared	 at	 me.	 Her	 body	 language</p>
<p class="calibre1">conflicted	with	the	glint	of	fear	in	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WHY.	NOT?”	she	said	through	clenched	teeth.	Her	change	in	tone	took	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	today	is	the	day	he	decides	to	fix	it?”	I	questioned	back,	laying	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-eaten	piece	of	bread	down	on	the	table	and	glaring	back	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged	and	took	a	large	bite	of	her	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	you	have	to	eat	like	that?”	I	covered	my	ears	with	my	hands	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	my	eyes.	It	was	gross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be…uz…it….ugs….ou.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	dropped	my	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 chewed	 some	 more	 before	 swallowing	 and	 then	 wiped	 her	 mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	back	of	her	hand.	“Because.	It.	Bugs.	You.”	She	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	and	chuckled.	There	was	no	point	in	arguing	with	her.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>finished	eating	in	silence,	and	I	was	relieved	Beth	had	given	up	pestering	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	myself	staring	up	at	the	window,	drawn	toward	it	like	metal	to	a	magnet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	seconds	later,	Beth	stood	by	my	side;	her	warm	hand	rested	on	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	he's	s-still	alive?”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?”	Jasper's	face	flashed	in	my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jasper.	Cecil,”	she	paused,	“anyone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	patted	her	hand.	“I	don't	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	going	to	g-get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	and	smiled.	“Come	on;	help	me	with	the	table.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	beautiful	sunny	day.	The	sunlight	was	comforting	as	I	picked	and	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 bits	 of	 hard,	 rubbery	 material.	 Some	 chunks	 were	 dry	 and	 brittle,	 others stretchy.	The	work	was	slow,	but	I	made	progress.	After	some	time,	I	finally	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 small	 spot	 where	 I'd	 managed	 to	 pull	 out	 all	 the	 sealant.	 “Go	 to	 the	 door!”	 I said	to	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	listen	for	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 rose	 from	 the	 table	 and	 went	 to	 the	 invisible	 door.	 “What	 are	 you	 d-doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trying	 something.”	 I	 lay	 down	 on	 my	 back	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 cabinet.	 I wiggled	around	and	hugged	my	knees	to	my	chest,	my	hair	hung	down	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell!”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	a	good	piece	out.	Going	to	see	if	I	can	kick	this	thing	loose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	careful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	listen	for	him.”	I	spread	my	knees	and	looked	at	the	window	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	then	stretched	out	my	legs	until	my	feet	made	contact.	There	wouldn't	be	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	of	power	in	my	thrust	as	my	knees	were	still	bent,	but	I	had	to	try.	I	pulled back	my	legs,	squeezed	my	eyes	shut,	and	pushed	away	the	thought	of	my	bare</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	smacking	the	edge	of	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!”	Beth	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	knees	dropped	back	toward	my	chest.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	nightgown	and	Beth's	came	flying	over	and	landed	on	my	face	before	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	catch	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wrap	them	around	your	f-feet,”	Beth	said	as	I	heard	her	footsteps	tap	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	and	wrapped	a	nightgown	around	each	foot.  <i class="calibre3">At	least	it	won't	hurt	as</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">much. </i>	I	readied	myself	and	thrust	my	legs	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>There	wasn't	a	lot	of	time	between	the	thrust	of	my	legs	and	the	landing	of my	feet.	There	wasn't	a	lot	of	time	between	the	thud	against	the	window	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jarring	 pain.	 It	 travelled	 up	 my	 legs	 and	 into	 my	 lower	 back.	 I	 groaned,	 re-positioned	myself,	and	tried	again.	The	second	time	did	not	hurt	as	much,	but	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	just	as	futile.  <i class="calibre3">Third	time's	the	charm</i>,	a	voice	whispered	in	my	head,	and	I knew	it	was	my	father's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sweat	dripped	down	from	my	temples	and	soaked	into	my	hair.	I	squeezed</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 eyes	 shut	 and	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 My	 knees	 folded	 against	 my	 chest.	 I counted	to	three	in	my	head	and	let	my	legs	go	like	they	were	spring	loaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dust	and	dirt	from	the	rafters	coated	my	sweat	soaked	face	as	my	wrapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	made	contact	with	the	window.	The	thud	was	louder	than	the	previous	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">times.	The	pain	in	my	body	was	worse	than	the	first	time.	I	rolled	over	onto	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	into	a	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay!”	Bethany's	worried	voice	called	from	below	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 I	 groaned	 and	 hung	 my	 arm	 over	 the	 edge,	 waving	 her	 away	 as	 the pain	 subsided.	 After	 a	 few	 more	 moments	 I	 sat	 up	 and	 looked	 to	 see	 if	 I	 had accomplished	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	eye	alone	the	window	looked	intact	and	fixed	in	place.	My	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed	along	the	edge	where	my	feet	had	landed	and	detected	slight	movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pushed	harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoop!”	I	yelled	and	covered	my	mouth	with	my	hand	in	almost	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant.	The	movement	was	not	only	felt	but	also	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it?”	Beth's	excited	voice	cried	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Almost!	 Finish	 what	 you	 were	 doing;	 I'll	 be	 down	 in	 a	 bit.”	 I	 wiped	 the sweat	 from	 my	 forehead	 and	 sat	 back	 against	 the	 window.	 Beth	 returned	 to building	her	board	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiny	flecks	of	dust	danced	in	the	sunbeam	that	shone	over	my	shoulders.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved	my	hands	through	the	air,	and	the	specks	swirled	around.	I	lost	myself	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dancing	and	falling	of	each	little	particle.	I	pretended	they	were	alive	as	they moved	and	floated	through	the	air.	The	sun	warmed	the	back	of	my	head,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	 nice.	 I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 and	 imagined	 sitting	 on	 a	 tree	 stump	 as	 I	 heard	 the faint	sound	of	birds	singing	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	what	have	we	here?”	His	voice	sang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 eyes	 sprung	 open.	 My	 heart	 gave	 a	 sudden	 jolt,	 thumping	 as	 though	 it were	 trying	 to	 break	 free	 from	 my	 chest.	 I	 was	 speechless.	 Bethany	 sat	 at	 the table	 only	 feet	 away	 from	 him.	 Her	 mouth	 was	 open,	 and	 it	 was	 obvious	 from her	 reaction	 that	 she	 hadn't	 heard	 him	 come	 in	 either.	 He	 stepped	 another	 foot into	the	room.	Beth	remained	at	the	table,	while	I	froze	in	place	on	the	top	of	the cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>“What's	 the	 matter?”	 he	 wheezed	 as	 he	 stared	 over	 at	 Beth.	 “You	 aren't usually	at	a	loss	for	words.”	His	wrinkled	purple	shirt	clung	to	him	with	sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	jumped	to	her	feet	and	folded	her	arms.	“I,”	she	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth!”	 I	 warned	 and	 scrambled	 down	 from	 the	 cabinet.	 In	 my	 haste,	 the chair	shifted	a	bit,	and	I	almost	fell.	I	regained	my	balance	as	I	found	my	way	to the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tsk,	tsk.”	Cecil	clicked	his	tongue	and	ran	a	hand	through	his	sweaty	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 had	 returned	 to	 her	 mat,	 and	 I	 moved	 in	 beside	 her.	 Her	 eyes narrowed,	and	her	cheeks	had	taken	on	a	pink	glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	past	us	and	up	at	the	window,	before	settling	his	grey	glare	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I…I	just	wanted	to	feel	the	s-sun.”	I	stammered.	My	heart	thumped.	I	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	deep	breath	and	tried	to	calm	my	nerves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 smiled.	 “Hmph!	 Is	 that	 all?	 Sounded	 a	 little	 noisy.	 Anyway,”	 his	 mood improved,	 “I	 did	 say	 I	 was	 going	 to	 fix	 it.”	 He	 turned	 and	 headed	 back	 to	 the door.	“Oh!”	He	spun	around;	his	sudden	movement	startled	me.	“I	brought	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">something.”	He	held	up	one	finger	gesturing	a	moment	and	walked	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	second	later	he	rolled	in	another	cot.	“I	thought	you	might	want	one	too,”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	to	Bethany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	only	had	one,”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	shrugged.	“I	did,	but…Well,	I	might	have	told	a	little	lie.”	He	held	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	thumb	and	index	finger	and	pinched	them	together.	“I	don't	think	we'll	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	one	anymore.”	He	smirked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	stomach	knotted.	“How's	Jasper?”	My	question	sounded	desperate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil's	grey	eyes	flicked	over	to	me,	and	he	smirked.	“Still	alive,	but	not	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">long.”	He	coughed	and	left	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	 Bethany	 and	 I	 exhaled	 as	 the	 sound	 of	 the	 lock	 filled	 our	 ears.	 Once again,	 I	 was	 thankful	 for	 his	 nasty	 cough.	 It	 always	 sent	 him	 running	 from	 the room	and	managed	to	save	us	from	further	torment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	get	what	he	m-means	by	'fix	it',”	Beth	said	turning	back	to	look	up	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	window,	“it's	n-not	broken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	sort	of	is	–	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	he'll	clean	it	f-from	outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	long	as	he	doesn't	push	on	it	too	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shrugged.	“He	won't	notice.	How	about	that	board	game?”	She	changed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	subject	and	pointed	to	the	game	set	up	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might	as	well.	There's	nothing	else	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 sat	 down,	 and	 while	 Beth	 finished	 setting	 up	 the	 last	 little	 pieces,	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>glanced	over	at	the	window.	It	was	dirty,	but	plenty	of	light	shone	through.	My stomach	tightened,	I	didn't	think	cleaning	the	window	was	what	he	intended	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a><b class="calibre4">Twenty-Nine	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Sleep	on	it</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	spent	at	least	half	of	the	night	awake,	tossing	and	turning	between	my	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	my	right	side.	My	hip	ached	as	my	bones	pressed	through	the	mat	and	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hard	floor.	I	wanted	to	lie	the	other	way	and	give	my	hip	a	break,	but	facing the	door	wasn't	an	option.	The	last	time	I	had,	I	woke	and	felt	quite	disoriented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 sent	 me	 into	 a	 panic	 as	 I	 thought	 Cecil	 was	 in	 the	 room.	 Beth	 slept	 every which	way,	though	she	believed	otherwise.	She	insisted	because	she	fell	asleep</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	woke	on	her	left	side	that	she	had	spent	the	entire	night	in	the	same	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	tell	her,	but	she	would	not	consider	it.	After	a	few	silly	arguments	on the	subject,	I	stopped	trying	to	convince	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morning	announced	its	arrival	through	the	window;	the	long	night	had	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	an	end.	I	sat	up	and	stretched	my	arms	above	my	head,	feeling	my	bones	crack</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	my	skin.	I	pulled	on	my	dirty,	green	dress	and	tiptoed	over	to	the	corner</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	housed	our	waste	buckets.	The	cots	had	finally	become	useful.	We	used	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	them	in	their	folded	positions	as	half	walls,	which	gave	us	a	little	privacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	notice	the	change	when	I'd	walked	over	to	our	makeshift	bathroom.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn't	sure	if	it	was	because	in	my	peripheral	vision	the	space	was	still	occupied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	 the	 dim	 light	 hadn't	 allowed	 me	 to	 see	 what	 was	 missing.	 Whatever	 the reason,	I	saw	it	on	my	return.	Two	small	stools	and	a	large	cardboard	box	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">upside	down,	had	replaced	our	table	and	chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth,	 wake	 up.”	 I	 stared	 at	 our	 newest	 pieces	 of	 furniture.	 It	 was	 evident that	my	night	hadn't	been	as	sleepless	as	I'd	thought.	Cecil	had	managed	to	sneak in	and	made	the	switch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Beth	yawned	and	cleared	her	throat	as	she	joined	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look.”	I	pointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	rubbed	her	eyes.	“When?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	and	shrugged.	I	had	hoped	she'd	heard	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	heard,”	she	whispered,	answering	my	unasked	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	girls!”	Startled,	we	spun	around	to	find	him	standing	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway.	It	took	all	I	had	not	to	rush	toward	him	and	knock	him	out	of	the	way.	I was	 angry.	 “Admiring	 your	 new	 furniture,	 I	 see.”	 A	 cough	 cut	 short	 his	 evil chuckle,	 and	 I	 hoped	 he'd	 choke	 and	 fall	 to	 the	 ground.	 I	 imagined	 running	 up and	kicking	him	as	hard	as	I	could	before	escaping	from	the	room.	“What	do	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think?”	he	said,	getting	his	cough	under	control	and	wiping	his	mouth	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	of	his	hand.	His	question	brought	me	back	from	my	daydream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	Bethany	said.	She	folded	her	arms	and	scowled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	 sister	 could	 have	 hurt	 herself	 when	 she	 climbed	 down	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>cabinet.	We	wouldn't	want	that.”	His	eyebrows	rose,	but	his	intonation	suggested he	didn't	care.	“Still,”	he	said	more	to	himself	than	to	us	as	he	turned	and	looked up	at	the	window,	“I	should	fix	that.”	He	turned	back	to	us	and	smirked	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 damn	 cough	 really	 makes	 me	 feel	 like	 not	 doing	 much	 of	 anything.”	 He looked	at	me,	and	then	shifted	his	gaze	towards	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How's	Jasper?”	I	blurted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	back	at	me	with	a	crooked	grin.	“Wouldn't	you	like	to	know,”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	then	turned	and	walked	back	out	the	door	without	another	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 throat	 tightened.	 I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 stomped	 over	 to	 my	 mat.	 I imagined	Cecil	laughing	as	he	heard	my	footsteps.	I	pulled	the	pocket	knife	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	hiding	place	and	dropped	it	into	my	pocket.	I	heard	the	faint	click	as	it	settled at	 the	 bottom	 and	 made	 contact	 with	 the	 brown	 button.	 “Come	 on.”	 I	 grabbed Beth's	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	w-we	doing?”	she	said	as	we	walked	over	to	the	cots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?	Are	you	b-boosting	me	up?	I'll	do	it…if	you	w-want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	 use	 these.	 Take	 the	 other	 end.”	 Not	 wanting	 Cecil	 to	 hear	 them	 roll across	the	floor,	we	carried	each	cot	over	to	the	cabinet.	We	placed	one	in	front of	the	other	and	pushed	them	up	against	the	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 <i class="calibre3">can</i>	do	it,”	Bethany	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	but	I'll	try	it	first.	I'm	not	sure	how	easy	this	is	going	to	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shrugged.	“Whatever.”	But	the	relief	I	saw	in	her	eyes	was	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	top	of	the	folded	cots	came	just	above	my	waist,	a	little	too	high	for	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 step	 onto	 from	 the	 floor.	 The	 bottom	 metal	 slat	 would	 give	 me	 the	 boost	 I needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 nodded	 and	 pressed	 her	 back	 into	 the	 folded	 beds,	 pushing	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">together.	She	extended	her	legs	out	in	front	of	her.	I	turned	the	metal	slat	on	its springs	 and	 lay	 my	 foot	 on	 the	 flat	 side.	 The	 thin	 metal	 bent	 a	 little	 with	 my weight.	I	reached	across	both	beds	and	steadied	myself	as	I	pushed	off	the	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 my	 other	 foot.	 The	 second	 all	 my	 weight	 was	 on	 the	 cot,	 it	 began	 to	 fall forward.	I	quickly	put	my	foot	back	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	them	still,	Beth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rolled	her	eyes.	“I	am.	They	keep	rolling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	on.”	I	bent	down	and	looked	at	the	wheels.	A	small	metal	piece	stuck</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	above	each	wheel,	and	I	pushed	them	down,	locking	them	into	place.	“They</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldn't	roll	now.”	I	got	into	position	again.	“Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	nodded	and	leaned	into	the	cots	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shoved	off	the	floor	with	one	foot.	The	metal	slat	bent	under	my	weight	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>I	drew	up	my	knee	and	placed	it	on	top	of	the	cots.	My	arms	pulled	me	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	huffed	as	she	steadied	the	beds.	A	sharp	sting	propelled	me	to	the	top	as	the edge	 of	 the	 thin	 metal	 slat	 sliced	 the	 underside	 of	 my	 foot.	 I	 sucked	 air	 in through	my	teeth	as	the	thin	skin	parted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	on	top	of	the	cots	and	leaned	against	the	cabinet	doors.	Both	hands	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bottom	 of	 my	 left	 foot;	 blood	 seeped	 between	 my	 fingers.	 “How	 bad?”	 I grunted.	My	stomach	turned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“M-move	your	hands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“I	don't	want	to.”	Throbbing	replaced	the	initial	sting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	it's	b-bleeding	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	tell	me	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sighed	and	folded	her	arms.	Her	icy	eyes	glared	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.”	I	moved	one	hand	at	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 leaned	 forward.	 “Bad	 news,	 it's	 b-bleeding	 and	 about	 this	 long.”	 She held	up	her	thumb	and	index	finger	to	show	about	a	one-inch	length	gash.	“G-good	 news,	 you'll	 live.	 Unless	 it	 g-gets	 infected.	 Which	 it	 won't.”	 She straightened	 herself.	 “But	 it	 might.”	 She	 walked	 away	 and	 came	 back	 a	 few seconds	later	with	water	and	a	few	tissues	from	our	dwindling	supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ow!	That	stings!”	I	pulled	my	foot	back	from	Beth's	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine	 if	 I	 had	 s-something	 like	 alcohol	 instead	 of	 w-water.	 Give	 it	 b-back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	allowed	my	sister	to	finish	cleaning	up	my	injury	the	best	she	could	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	we	had.	With	the	blood	washed	away,	Beth	saw	that	the	cut	was	clean	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shallow.	 It	 was	 not	 the	 type	 that	 would	 have	 needed	 stitches.	 She	 cut	 away another	piece	from	the	hem	of	her	dress	and	tied	it	around	the	bottom	of	my	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,	all	f-fixed.”	She	looked	up	at	me	and	handed	me	back	the	knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anytime.”	She	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	I've	wasted	enough	time.	Hold	those	things	steady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	turned	and	pressed	her	back	into	the	cots	once	again.	“You	w-want	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	it?	You're	hurt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shook	 my	 head.	 “I'm	 up	 this	 far.”	 I	 turned	 around	 and	 stretched	 my	 arms across	the	top	of	the	cabinet.	The	table	and	chair	were	taller	but	not	by	much.	I jumped	 off	 my	 good	 foot.	 I	 wiggled	 and	 pulled;	 my	 legs	 banged	 against	 the cabinet.	And	then	I	was	on	top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	up	yet?”	Beth	called.	She	still	stood	with	her	back	pushed	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	folded	beds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>She	turned	and	smiled	when	she	saw	me	on	top	of	the	wardrobe.	“Go	sit	in front	of	the	door	and	listen	for	him;	if	you	hear	anything	knock	on	the	floor,	and I'll	come	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	cots?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	have	to	move	them	back	quickly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 worked	 feverishly,	 digging	 the	 knife	 deep	 into	 the	 sealant.	 Small	 grey chunks	came	free	and	littered	the	top	of	the	cabinet,	but	I	could	not	clear	an	area like	I	had	the	last	time.	After	several	minutes,	I	stopped.	Hunger	and	exhaustion interfered	with	my	concentration.	My	fingers	ached	from	gripping	my	knife,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 neck	 and	 shoulders	 burned.	 The	 pain	 in	 my	 foot	 became	 a	 faint	 memory.	 I climbed	 back	 down,	 and	 with	 Beth's	 help,	 returned	 the	 folded	 beds	 to	 serve	 as bathroom	walls	once	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 sat	 at	 our	 crude	 table	 and	 ate	 our	 first	 meal	 of	 the	 day.	 Despite	 having replaced	 our	 table	 and	 chairs,	 Cecil	 had	 supplied	 us	 with	 more	 food.	 We discovered	a	new	cloth	bag	contained	several	cans	of	food	and	a	half-eaten	box</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	stale	cereal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 eyelids	 grew	 heavy,	 and	 it	 became	 difficult	 to	 keep	 them	 open	 as	 I finished	the	last	of	my	meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 need	 a	 n-nap.”	 Beth	 tilted	 her	 head	 to	 the	 side	 and	 gave	 me	 a	 half smile.	Her	icy	blue	eyes	filled	with	concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	and	rubbed	both	eyes	with	my	fingertips.	“I'm	fine.”	Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 right,	 but	 the	 thought	 of	 lying	 down	 on	 the	 thin	 mat	 with	 my	 aching	 body was	enough	to	keep	me	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	hardly	s-stay	awake.	You	almost	f-fell	asleep	eating.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	rest	here.”	I	folded	my	arms	on	top	of	the	cardboard	table	and	rested	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	It	was	uncomfortable	but	painless.	Through	the	haze	of	half-sleep,	I	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shuffle	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,”	she	whispered	a	few	moments	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 resisted	 the	 light	 tug	 on	 my	 arm	 and	 stayed	 seated	 on	 my	 stool.	 Another stronger	tug	and	my	body	rose	sleepily	from	my	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	whispered	in	my	semi-conscious	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	a	good	s-sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	tired	to	argue,	I	allowed	her	to	help	me	lie	down.	The	soft	mattress	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cot	cradled	my	body	as	I	settled	and	sunk	into	blissful	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Easy	come,	easy	go</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I	 know	 what	 you're	 up	 to.”	 His	 cruel	 voice	 whispered	 in	 my	 ear.	 His	 warm,</i> <i class="calibre3">stinking	breath	made	my	eyes	water. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">W-what	do	you	mean?”	I	stammered.	His	finger	jabbed	my	arm.	I	was	sure</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">it	was	going	to	bruise. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Don't	pretend	like	you	don't	know	what	I'm	talking	about.	You're	trying	to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">escape.”	His	grey	eyes	glared	at	me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">No,	we're	not!”	My	legs	buckled,	and	if	it	weren't	for	the	wall	he'd	backed</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">me	against,	I	would	have	fallen	to	the	floor. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Well,	you've	got	that	right.	You're	staying	here	until	you	rot. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	 bolted	 upright;	 my	 eyes	 searched	 for	 whispering	 shadows	 as	 they	 adjusted	 to the	 dark.	 Beth's	 breathing	 and	 my	 pounding	 heart	 were	 the	 only	 sounds	 in	 the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	wrong,”	I	whispered	back.	I	lay	back	down	on	my	cot	and	waited	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	return	of	sleep.	I	would	work	on	our	escape	when	morning	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“April,	April,	w-wake	up!”	Beth's	urgent	voice	buzzed	in	my	ear;	I	rolled	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	get	up.”	She	persisted	and	shook	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leave	me	alone,”	I	whined,	wanting	to	sleep	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	he's	gone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	words	woke	me,	and	I	rolled	toward	Bethany.	“Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	his	truck!”	She	scrunched	her	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 up	 and	 stretched.	 My	 body	 still	 ached,	 but	 it	 felt	 better	 than	 it	 had	 in weeks.	 Beth	 had	 already	 made	 me	 a	 breakfast	 of	 stale	 bread	 and	 jam,	 and	 she held	it	out	to	me	the	second	I	finished	yawning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eat!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saluted	and	took	the	piece	of	bread	from	her	outstretched	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	my	injured	foot,	I	was	able	to	climb	to	the	top	of	the	cabinet	faster	than the	last	time.	I	nudged	the	window,	its	slight	movement	gave	me	inspiration,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	set	to	work.	The	memory	of	my	nightmare	was	still	on	my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?”	Beth	said,	a	few	minutes	into	my	digging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	kept	working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	getting	any	m-more	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 but	 only	 a	 bit	 at	 a	 time.	 There's	 a	 lot	 of	 this	 stuff,	 and	 it's	 thick	 in places.”	 I	 sunk	 the	 knife	 in	 and	 pulled	 up	 a	 large	 piece.	 I	 grabbed	 it	 with	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>fingers	 and	 ripped	 it	 free.	 I	 held	 it	 up	 to	 show	 Beth	 and	 smiled.	 It	 was	 almost half	the	length	of	my	arm	–	the	biggest	piece	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes!	Does	that	make	another	empty	s-spot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	inspected	the	area	and	shook	my	head.	“Left	a	good	hole	but	I	can	still	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">some.	It's	layered	in	pretty	thick.	Maybe	a	bit	more	will	clean	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 been	 so	 busy	 working	 I'd	 forgotten	 to	 watch	 for	 his	 return.	 The	 sudden arrival	of	his	truck	as	it	pulled	up	to	the	house	surprised	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth,	hold	the	cots,”	I	called.	“Hurry,	he's	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 hurried	 over	 and	 pressed	 her	 back	 against	 the	 beds	 as	 I	 scrambled down.	 We	 carried	 each	 one	 back	 to	 their	 spot,	 afraid	 the	 rolling	 wheels	 would alert	 him.	 When	 everything	 was	 back	 in	 place,	 we	 grabbed	 our	 books	 and	 lay down	 to	 read.	 My	 foot	 throbbed	 a	 little	 as	 I	 tucked	 it	 under	 my	 sheet.	 A	 few minutes	later	he	stood	in	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	my	favourite	girls	today?	Well,	look	at	you	two	using	those	cots!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	and	pulled	the	sheet	over	my	bandaged	foot,	keeping	it	hidden	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	view.	He	stood	in	the	doorway,	a	grin	pasted	on	his	sweaty	face.	Though	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smell	 of	 his	 cologne	 was	 faint,	 it	 was	 still	 strong	 enough	 to	 make	 my	 nose wrinkle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	back	was	sore.”	I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	don't	get	too	used	to	them.	I	might	need	them	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	–	why?”	I	could	not	endure	the	thin	mat	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“In	case	you	get	any	brilliant	ideas.	You	know	like	using	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	climb	onto	the	cabinet	like	you	did	with	your	table.	Now	hold	on	a	minute,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	tapped	his	forehead	with	the	palm	of	his	hand.	“I've	just	gone	and	given	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	idea.	Come	on,	up	you	get.”	He	glared	at	Beth	as	he	approached.	Their	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">locked	in	a	staring	match. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 his	 attention	 elsewhere,	 I	 yanked	 the	 strip	 of	 cloth	 from	 my	 foot	 and hid	it	in	my	pocket.	His	distraction	was	temporary,	and	he	redirected	his	focus	as he	stood	in	front	of	my	cot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	don't	take	them.”	I	stood	up	and	touched	his	forearm.	His	rolled	shirt</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeves	exposed	his	skin,	and	it	was	warm	and	damp	under	my	hand.	He	shook</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	arm;	the	violent	motion	sent	me	back	onto	my	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	up,”	he	growled	as	he	brushed	a	hand	through	his	messy	grey	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 and	 I	 stood	 over	 to	 one	 side	 as	 he	 reached	 down	 and	 grabbed	 the edge	of	my	cot.	He	shook	the	mattress	and	the	foam	mat	from	the	frame.	I	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	breath	as	they	fell	to	the	floor,	afraid	he'd	find	my	tools	sandwiched	between them.	Luckily	the	mat	stuck	to	the	bottom,	and	they	fell	together.	Bethany's	cot</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 next,	 and	 she	 gasped	 as	 he	 dumped	 her	 mattress	 and	 blanket	 on	 the	 floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>The	exertion	sent	him	into	a	fit	of	coughs,	and	when	he	regained	control,	he	was bright	red.	Sweat	and	tears	trickled	down	his	face.	He	folded	the	bed	frames	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	them	out	of	the	room,	locking	the	door	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rushed	to	my	mattress	and	peeled	the	mat	free;	my	tools	were	still	safely	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	I	said	as	I	craned	my	neck	to	look	around	Beth.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	in	the	midst	of	gathering	the	few	things	Cecil	had	dumped	on	the	floor.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions	looked	more	suspicious	than	that	of	someone	trying	to	be	tidy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-nothing.”	 She	 kept	 her	 back	 toward	 me.	 Her	 tone	 heightened	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspicion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	Beth	huffed	and	turned	around.	Tucked	between	her	two	hands	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	small	brown	teddy	bear	she'd	pulled	from	one	of	the	boxes	in	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 jaw	 dropped.	 “How	 did	 you	 get	 that?”	 I	 pointed	 to	 the	 pitiful	 looking toy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shrugged.	“Took	it	the	day	we	found	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	put	it	back.	I	saw	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 you	 didn't	 see.	 I	 started	 p-putting	 stuff	 back	 in	 the	 box	 while	 you worked	 on	 the	 cabinet.	 I	 stuffed	 him	 under	 my	 d-dress	 until	 I	 could	 hide	 him under	my	blanket.”	A	mischievous	grin	spread	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 if	 he'd	 have	 found	 it?”	 I	 hissed;	 warmth	 filled	 my	 cheeks	 at	 the thought.	 “He	 would	 have	 known	 we	 were	 in	 the	 cabinet.”	 My	 gaze	 drifted toward	the	little	bear,	and	he	appeared	to	wink	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pfft!”	 Beth	 dismissed	 my	 comment	 with	 a	 wave	 of	 her	 hand.	 Her	 cheeks were	as	pink	as	I	imagined	my	own	to	be.	“He	had	no	m-more	a	chance	finding</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 bear	 than	 he	 d-did	 finding	 your	 knife	 and	 other	 stuff.	 I'm	 pretty	 sure	 he'd have	 m-more	 of	 a	 p-problem	 with	 those.”	 She	 turned	 away	 and	 went	 back	 to making	her	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tools	lay	on	the	bottom	of	my	mattress.	I	covered	them	with	the	thin	mat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	flipped	the	whole	thing	over.	Beth	had	a	point.	Her	teddy	bear	was	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared	to	the	small	arsenal	of	sharp	objects	I	kept	hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where's	 my	 knife?”	 A	 quick	 search	 of	 the	 floor	 around	 me	 provided	 no answer.	 I	 turned	 my	 attention	 to	 Beth;	 she	 was	 straightening	 her	 things	 but stopped	long	enough	to	shrug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 didn't	 matter	 that	 my	 pocket	 was	 not	 weighed	 down.	 I	 stuck	 my	 hand inside	it	anyway.	My	fingers	entangled	in	the	strip	of	cloth	and	grazed	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">button.	A	sweat	broke	out	on	my	forehead	at	the	thought	of	the	loss	of	my	best</p>
<p class="calibre1">tool.  <i class="calibre3">But	 how	 could	 it	 be?	 I'd	 only	 just	 used	 it. </i>	 My	 memory	 shifted	 to	 the cabinet;	I'd	left	it	on	top	in	my	haste	to	climb	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>“Did	you	find	it?”	Bethany	said	as	she	stood	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pointed	 to	 the	 top	 of	 the	 cabinet	 and	 looked	 at	 Beth.	 There	 was	 only	 one way	we	were	going	to	get	that	knife	back.	We	tiptoed	over	to	the	large	piece	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">furniture,	 and	 I	 laced	 my	 fingers	 together	 for	 her.	 She	 hesitated	 for	 a	 moment then	placed	her	foot	in	my	hand.	A	tense	few	seconds	later	and	she'd	climbed	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	there?”	I	stood	back	from	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sat	with	her	back	to	the	window	and	held	up	the	knife	“Yup!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	come	down.”	The	tension	in	my	body	eased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	w-want	to	look	out	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	pressed	her	lips	together	in	determination	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	be	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	moved	with	care	and	faced	the	window.	“Uh!”	she	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	the	matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“H-he's	out	there,”	she	whispered</p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	raced.	“Get	down	before	he	sees	you.”	I	panicked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	th-think…I	think	he	d-did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-One	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Shadows	and	Dark	Shapes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 days	 had	 passed	 before	 he	 surprised	 us	 with	 another	 visit.	 And	 if	 he	 had seen	 Beth	 looking	 out	 the	 window,	 he	 kept	 it	 to	 himself.	 He	 brought	 us	 more books,	more	food	–	more	anxiety.	He	had	shown	up	again	the	next	day,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	 after	 that.	 Each	 time	 the	 door	 opened,	 I	 held	 my	 breath.	 He	 had	 become unpredictable,	and	so	once	again,	we	stopped	working	on	our	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	visits	were	quick	and,	for	the	most	part,	silent.	He'd	walk	into	the	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 look	 around,	 his	 survey	 always	 ending	 at	 the	 window.	 He'd	 chuckle	 under his	breath	and	grin	at	some	inside	joke.	Then	he	would	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	appearance	had	changed	as	well.	His	once	bright	white	hair	had	dulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	dirt.	He	no	longer	changed	his	shirts	and	wore	only	the	purple	one	stained</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	sweat	and	whatever	else	he'd	spilled	on	it.	His	personal	scent	replaced	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">cologne.	Gone	were	his	bright,	grey	eyes	that	had	shone	with	whatever	plans	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 had	 for	 the	 future.	 They	 had	 dulled	 and	 became	 the	 eyes	 of	 a	 man	 who purely	 existed.	 The	 well-groomed	 man	 we'd	 remembered	 from	 C.E.C.I.L.	 had turned	into	a	dishevelled	and	dirty	mess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 had	 feared	 him	 before,	 but	 this	 quieter	 Cecil	 was	 one	 we	 feared	 even more.	 His	 words	 had	 once	 been	 a	 window	 into	 his	 mind,	 but	 now	 his	 silence cloaked	his	thoughts.	He	had	something	planned,	and	my	body	was	in	a	constant</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	of	tension	as	we	waited	for	its	enactment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	floor	beneath	my	mattress	had	become	well	etched	with	marks	for	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	of	our	captivity.	Each	new	scratch	had	spurred	the	need	for	escape,	fear	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turmoil	prevented	our	progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	one	brief	visit,	Cecil	had	left	with	our	stools.	He'd	come	into	our	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty	handed,	stared	up	at	the	window,	and	then	took	the	remaining	furnishings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 action	 brought	 about	 a	 renewed	 interest	 in	 working	 on	 our	 only	 escape route.	 Unfortunately,	 with	 no	 other	 way	 to	 reach	 the	 top	 of	 the	 cabinet,	 Beth would	have	to	take	over	the	work.	I	would	listen	for	Cecil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 morning	 at	 dawn,	 I	 helped	 Beth	 to	 the	 top	 of	 the	 wardrobe.	 She worked	 in	 the	 dim	 light	 until	 the	 sun	 peaked	 over	 the	 trees.	 The	 progress	 was slow,	but	she	worked	hard.	The	desperate	situation	had	kept	her	fear	of	heights</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppressed	as	she	dug	out	the	sealant.	She	stuffed	each	chunk	she	removed	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	back	of	the	cabinet	and	shoved	on	the	window	every	few	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	morning,	after	his	truck	had	rumbled	away,	Beth	threw	a	can	of	food	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 glass.	 We	 had	 hoped	 it	 would	 crack,	 but	 it	 only	 bounced	 off	 with	 a	 loud rattle.	Hot	and	frustrated	she	had	climbed	back	down.	She	returned	in	the	early</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening	before	the	sun	had	set	and	fought	the	window	again.	She	would	not	give</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 up	 in	 the	 dark,	 sweat	 soaked.	 The	 sound	 of	 rain	 pounding	 on	 the	 roof resonated	throughout	the	dark	room.	A	smile	spread	across	my	face;	it	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 time	 since	 it	 had	 rained.	 The	 sound	 was	 soothing,	 and	 I	 hoped	 it	 would cool	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 darkness,	 I	 could	 make	 out	 Bethany's	 sleeping	 body	 beside	 me,	 her breathing	 slow	 and	 easy.	 I	 was	 envious	 of	 her	 but	 happy	 at	 the	 same	 time.	 At least	 one	 of	 us	 could	 enjoy	 sound	 sleep.	 I	 couldn't	 remember	 the	 last	 time	 I'd slept	without	waking,	though	I	suspected	it	was	while	under	Cecil's	drugs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	touched	Beth's	arm.	Her	skin	was	cool,	and	she	lay	quiet	and	still.	I	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 hand	 away	 and	 searched	 at	 the	 head	 of	 my	 mattress	 for	 the	 flashlight.	 I turned	 it	 on	 while	 keeping	 my	 hand	 over	 the	 lens.	 Blue-white	 light	 filtered through	my	fingers,	casting	ominous	shadows	on	the	overhead	beams.	I	lowered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	light	to	the	floor	and	searched	Beth's	mattress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	small,	brown	teddy	bear	lay	in	the	crook	of	her	arm.	I	reached	over	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gently	tugged	it	free.	Beth	snorted	and	rolled	away	from	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	inspected	the	small	stuffed	toy	I	held	in	my	left	hand,	while	my	right	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto	the	flashlight.	I	flipped	the	old	bear	over	onto	his	front.	There	were	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">worn	patches	in	his	fur,	and	the	seam	down	his	back	looked	like	it	had	been	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">stitched.	He	was	a	rather	ordinary	bear,	bedraggled,	but	well	loved.	I	flipped	him back	 over	 and	 poked	 him	 in	 his	 little	 belly;	 I	 snickered	 at	 myself	 for	 the impromptu	action.	The	teddy	had	a	kind	smile.	The	black	on	his	nose	had	worn</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	in	spots	so	that	it	looked	more	brown	than	black.	My	finger	trailed	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	nose	to	the	spot	between	his	winking	eyes.	And	then	I	saw	for	the	first	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	wasn't	winking,	he	was	missing	an	eye.	My	finger	rubbed	over	his	one	brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye	 and	 then	 to	 the	 place	 where	 the	 other	 was	 missing.	 There	 was	 a	 tiny	 hole where	it	had	once	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lay	down	and	turned	away	from	Beth,	bringing	the	bear	and	the	flashlight</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 me.	 I	 tucked	 the	 flashlight	 up	 against	 my	 body.	 Its	 light	 shone	 across	 the floor	and	up	the	hidden	door.	I	placed	the	bear	in	front	and	moved	him	back	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth.	 The	 teddy's	 shadow	 grew	 and	 shrunk	 with	 the	 movement.	 I	 sighed	 and closed	my	eyes.	Is	this	it?	Is	watching	the	shadow	of	a	stuffed	bear	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 only	 entertainment?	 The	 flashlight	 flickered	 and	 dimmed.	 I	 shut	 it	 off	 to preserve	 whatever	 battery	 power	 was	 left	 and	 returned	 it	 to	 the	 spot	 above	 my head.	I	tucked	the	little	bear	up	against	my	stomach	as	my	eyes	stared	in	the	dark toward	the	invisible	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	chink	of	light	appeared	under	the	door	and	along	the	edge.	I	gasped	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tucked	the	teddy	under	my	nightgown.	The	door	swung	open,	and	light	flowed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>into	the	room.	For	a	brief	moment	I	caught	sight	of	his	black	silhouette	standing in	the	doorway,	and	I	closed	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lay	motionless.	I	sensed	he	stood	beside	me;	near	enough	that	if	I	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 with	 my	 hand,	 I	 would	 feel	 his	 foot.	 It	 took	 all	 my	 strength	 to	 keep	 my breathing	slow	and	steady	despite	my	thumping	heart.	After	a	few	seconds,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	 carried	 him	 away	 as	 they	 shuffled	 and	 creaked	 along	 the	 floorboards.	 I waited	 and	 fought	 my	 body's	 attempt	 to	 panic.	 And	 when	 he	 finally	 left,	 I exhaled	the	breath	I	had	been	holding.	My	body	shook,	and	tears	streamed	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	eyes.	The	weeks	of	fear	and	frustration	released	like	a	thundercloud	bursting</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	going	on?”	A	sleepy	voice	whispered	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.”	I	wiped	the	tears	from	my	face	and	exhaled	a	shaky	breath.	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	facing	the	door	–	paralyzed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	warm	hand	rested	on	my	shoulder.	“Was	he	here?”	Her	voice	sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	little	more	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	he	w-want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	had	he	wanted? </i>	“I	don't	know…to	stare	at	us.”	I	wrinkled	my	face	as	I spoke	 the	 words.	 It	 was	 strange,	 but	 I	 never	 heard	 any	 sound	 other	 than	 his walking	towards	us	and	then	walking	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sense	 of	 his	 standing	 so	 close	 came	 to	 mind.	 “Yes.”	 I	 rolled	 over	 onto my	back,	pulled	my	sheet	up	to	my	chin,	and	shivered.	It	was	still	warm	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	but	he'd	left	a	cold	chill	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	yawned.	”Goodnight,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	up	at	the	darkened	ceiling,	remembering	the	bear	as	I	did.	I	pulled	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	from	underneath	my	nightgown.	I	held	it	at	arms-length	and	rocked	it	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark.	 His	 winking	 face	 crossed	 my	 mind	 as	 my	 arms	 dropped	 back	 down,	 and my	eyelids	grew	heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	weight	of	my	body	pressed	into	the	mattress.	Sleep	crept	in.	I	fought	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	couldn't	stop	its	advance.	I	only	hoped	it	wouldn't	bring	him	back	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	each	exhale,	I	drifted	closer	to	unconsciousness.	As	the	final	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 awareness	 drifted	 away,	 my	 ears	 picked	 up	 a	 light	 tapping	 overhead.	 Soon there	would	only	be	the	sound	of	our	even	breathing	and	the	rain	drumming	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Two	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Beggars	can't	be	Choosers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stretched	 my	 arms	 over	 my	 head	 and	 yawned	 before	 opening	 my	 still	 sleepy eyes.	Beth's	empty	bed	lay	in	front	of	me.	My	heart	skipped	for	a	moment	until	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	her	humming	the	only	tune	she	remembered.	I	cringed	at	the	memory	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 song	 that	 had	 once	 been	 a	 childhood	 favourite	 but	 was	 now	 surrounded	 by mystery.	 I	 rubbed	 the	 remaining	 sleep	 from	 my	 eyes.	 The	 room	 was	 still	 dark, and	 I	 could	 just	 make	 out	 Beth	 rooting	 through	 something	 on	 our	 cardboard table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Food?”	 I	 said	 at	 the	 sound	 of	 clanging	 tin	 cans.	 I	 picked	 up	 the	 flashlight before	rising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya.”	She	didn't	bother	to	look	at	me	as	she	continued	searching	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloth	 bag.	 The	 memory	 of	 his	 late	 night	 visit	 returned.	 I	 had	 been	 so	 sure	 that he'd	done	nothing	but	watch	us	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	back	cracked	as	I	stretched	my	arms	over	my	head	again	and	rolled	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">neck.	It	felt	good	to	no	longer	feel	achy	upon	waking	like	I	had	when	I	slept	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	thin	mat.	I	yawned	again	and	made	my	way	over	to	Beth;	my	eyes	watered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 up	 early.”	 The	 sky	 outside	 the	 window	 was	 still	 dark	 though	 I suspected	dawn	would	arrive	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	pulled	a	few	cans	of	food	from	the	bag.	She	shrugged.	“I	couldn't	sleep</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	flashlight	flickered	with	the	click	of	the	switch.	I	reached	for	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cans	on	the	table	and	turned	it	in	my	hand.	The	dull	beam	of	light	was	just	bright enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 food,	 the	 best	 before	 date	 was	 either	 near	 its	 expiry	 or had	 just	 past.	 Some	 cans	 had	 no	 date,	 and	 I	 could	 only	 assume	 that	 they	 were still	 good.	 What	 I	 didn't	 understand,	 was	 where	 it	 came	 from.  <i class="calibre3">Was	 it	 food</i> <i class="calibre3">rescued	from	C.E.C.I.L	or	was	he	getting	it	from	some	other	source? </i>	I	placed	the can	 back	 on	 the	 table	 as	 the	 door	 of	 the	 room	 swung	 open	 and	 caught	 us	 by surprise.	We	stood	still	and	stared	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 are	 you	 here?”	 I	 snapped,	 much	 to	 mine	 and	 Beth's	 surprise,	 as	 his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Visiting	us	at	dawn	was	not	something	he	had	a	habit	of	doing.	I	was	glad	Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn't	working	on	the	window.	I	set	the	still	illuminated	flashlight	in	the	centre of	the	cardboard	box.	The	beam	pointed	at	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sneered	and	approached	the	table.	A	stray	lock	of	dirty,	white	hair	hung</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	his	one	eye,	but	he	didn't	bother	to	brush	it	away.	“I	was	wondering	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	left	that	bag,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	 eyes	 narrowed,	 and	 her	 knuckles	 whitened	 as	 she	 gripped	 the	 bag's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>handles	tighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil's	eyes	roamed	over	the	top	of	our	cardboard	box	table.	“Why	don't	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	 those	 cans	 back	 in	 the	 bag	 for	 me?”	 He	 smiled	 at	 Beth.	 “I	 left	 it	 here	 by mistake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	bad!”	Beth	shrugged	and	glared	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	raised	his	eyebrows	and	snorted	with	contempt.	“Yes,	it	is	too	bad,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.”	He	reached	over	and	snatched	the	bag	from	her	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	cried	out,	pulled	her	hands	up	to	her	face,	and	inspected	her	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	 me	 those,”	 he	 commanded	 as	 he	 pointed	 his	 chin	 in	 the	 direction	 of the	few	cans	lying	on	the	cardboard	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	up	the	cans	one-by-one	and	tossed	them	into	the	bag	he	held	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	all	you	came	for?”	I	snapped	again.	My	stomach	muscles	tightened	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">glared	at	me	with	threatening	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	I	was	going	to	let	you	keep	a	can	or	two,	but	now,”	he	wagged</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	finger	at	me,	“now	I'm	not	so	sure	either	of	you	deserves	it.”	He	spun	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!”	I	closed	my	eyes	as	my	mouth	spoke	before	my	brain	had	a	chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 grabbed	 my	 arm.	 “What	 are	 you	 d-doing?”	 she	 whispered	 through</p>
<p class="calibre1">clenched	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	sorry.”	Beth's	grip	tightened	on	my	arm.	“I	didn't	mean	to,	please.”	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomach	rumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	stood	still	with	his	back	to	us	for	a	moment	before	turning.	He	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	that's	better.	This	doesn't	have	to	be	difficult,”	he	said,	finally	brushing	the errant	lock	of	hair	from	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 we…can	 we	 please	 have	 one	 can.”	 I	 cringed	 as	 I	 heard	 myself	 beg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	huffed	and	released	her	grip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	dropped	his	chin	and	raised	his	eyebrows.	“Are	you	begging?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm,	I	suppose	I	could	leave	you	something.”	He	reached	into	the	bag	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	out	a	can.	I	held	my	breath	as	it	was	one	that	had	yet	to	expire.	“Perhaps not	this	one,”	he	said	and	placed	it	back	in	the	bag.	He	pulled	out	another;	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders	 dropped.	 “How	 about	 this?	 Do	 you	 like	 beans?	 Well,	 I	 suppose	 that doesn't	really	matter,	does	it?”	He	waved	his	hand	through	the	air	dismissing	his question.	 “That	 was	 a	 stupid	 question.”	 He	 held	 the	 can	 out	 toward	 me.	 “Take it!”	he	snapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	out	and	took	the	can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	else?”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 tip	 of	 my	 tongue	 poked	 out	 from	 between	 my	 lips,	 and	 I	 licked	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 we	 have	 another?”	 My	 heart	 raced.	 If	 he	 said	 no,	 I	 wasn't	 going	 to	 beg</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stared	 at	 me	 for	 a	 moment,	 his	 dull	 grey	 eyes	 brightening	 a	 little	 as	 I gazed	 back.	 “One	 more,”	 he	 said	 and	 pulled	 out	 another	 can.	 “I	 don't	 like peaches	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grabbed	the	can	before	he	could	change	his	mind.	He	turned	to	leave,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	my	mouth	stopped	him	before	my	brain	registered.	“Wait!”	I	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	really	getting	annoying,”	Cecil	said	as	he	turned	to	face	me.	“I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily	take	those	back.”	His	eyes	darted	between	the	can	I	held	in	each	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	these	come	from?”	I	held	up	the	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	narrowed	his	eyes	for	a	moment	as	though	he	didn't	quite	understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 question.	 But	 then	 they	 brightened	 a	 little	 as	 it	 registered.	 “For	 years,	 we stockpiled	and	stored	cans	at	C.E.C.I.L.	for	emergencies.	We	didn't	need	them	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	grew	our	own	fresh	food	and	farmed	our	own	meat.	You	always	had	the	best</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	freshest	of	food.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	now?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	it's	an	emergency.	I	took	as	much	as	I	could	before	C.E.C.I.L.	burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	of	course,	we	had	a	good	supply	here	as	well.	However,	there	isn't	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	all	of	us.”	He	turned	and	headed	back	to	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	us	go!”	I	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	once	again	and	hesitated	before	turning	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya,	let	us	go.”	Beth's	voice	chimed	in	as	she	stepped	up	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph!	You'd	like	that,	but	I	don't	think	so.	Not	until	I	have	what	I	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	brow	creased.	“What	do	you	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	see,	my	dear.	Someone	has	something	of	mine	and	until	I	get	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	I	have	something	of	theirs.”	He	pulled	open	the	door	and	walked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 and	 I	 stood	 there	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 invisible	 door	 as	 the	 lock	 clicked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	light	flickered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	d-does	that	mean?”	Beth	clicked	off	the	switch	on	the	dying</p>
<p class="calibre1">flashlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth!”	I	stared	at	my	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“What?	I	used	to	say	that	and	w-worse	all	the	t-time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	memories?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rolled	 my	 eyes.	 “I	 don't	 have	 a	 clue	 what	 that	 means,”	 I	 said	 answering Beth's	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	eat!	You	can't	th-think	properly	on	an	empty	stomach.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	She	stared	at	me	wide-eyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad	used	to	say	that	all	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>“I	 know.”	 She	 smiled	 and	 grabbed	 the	 can	 opener	 from	 the	 top	 of	 our cardboard	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	down	on	our	mattresses	and	ate	small	bites	from	the	can	of	beans	he'd</p>
<p class="calibre1">left.	While	we	still	had	a	few	remaining	tins	from	previous	visits,	the	beans	were the	 oldest.	 We	 hoped	 the	 protein	 would	 help	 keep	 up	 our	 strength.	 They	 didn't taste	the	greatest.	I	didn't	know	if	it	was	because	of	the	flavour	or	the	expiry,	but they	kept	our	stomachs	from	complaining	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	th-think	he	was	talking	about?”	Beth	said	as	she	lay	on	her	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	played	with	the	small	bear,	holding	it	high	above	her	as	I	had	done	the	night before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know.”	I	lay	down	on	my	back	and	stared	up	at	the	beams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	th-think	he's	gone	c-crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	in	agreement	and	closed	my	eyes.	My	mind	replayed	Cecil's	visit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 his	 words.  <i class="calibre3">Who	 could	 have	 something	 he	 wants	 and	 what	 does	 he	 have? </i>	 I squeezed	my	eyelids	tighter.	Little	white	specks	floated	underneath	like	far	away stars	in	the	night	sky.  <i class="calibre3">What	does	Cecil	have? </i>	I	questioned	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	listed	the	most	obvious	things,	the	house,	or	whatever	our	prison	was,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truck,	Jasper	–	if	he	was	still	alive.	My	stomach	tightened	at	the	thought,	and	I shook	 my	 head	 not	 wanting	 to	 believe	 the	 worst.	 He	 had	 food,	 but	 by	 his account,	there	wasn't	much.	Whatever	other	artifacts	or	treasures	lay	behind	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	 door,	 was	 a	 mystery.	 My	 hand	 absently	 reached	 down	 the	 front	 of	 my dress,	and	I	pulled	out	the	locket	and	rubbed	it	between	my	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	sprung	open.	“He	has	us,”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	voice	made	me	jump	as	I'd	forgotten	she	was	lying	beside	me.	I	rolled</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	and	faced	her,	propping	my	head	up	on	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 has	 us,”	 I	 said	 louder,	 convinced	 that	  <i class="calibre3">we</i>	 were	 whatever	 someone	 was looking	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	rolled	over	and	mirrored	me,	dropping	the	bear	on	the	floor	between	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	t-talking	about?”	She	scrunched	her	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cecil	 said	 'someone	 has	 something	 he	 wants	 and	 he	 has	 something	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">theirs.' ”	 I	 widened	 my	 eyes	 as	 Beth	 narrowed	 hers	 again.	 Her	 icy	 gaze brightened	as	my	words	registered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shook	 my	 head.	 A	 thought	 came	 to	 mind,	 and	 my	 heart	 skipped	 a	 beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom	and	dad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	r-really	think	so?”	Beth's	eyes	couldn't	get	any	wider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”I	 don't	 know,	 but	 I	 can	 hope.”	 I	 looked	 away	 from	 Beth	 and	 up	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>window.	Dawn	had	arrived	and	another	day	was	about	to	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Three	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Tit	for	Tat</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	hungry,”	Beth	whined.	Her	growling	stomach	made	her	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	I	am	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	the	hell	is	he	c-coming	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“I	don't	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	w-want	me	to.”	Beth	held	up	her	fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it's	my	turn.”	I	stood	in	front	of	the	hidden	door	and	took	a	deep	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 hey…can	 you	 hear	 me?”	 My	 fist	 pounded.	 Despite	 taking	 turns</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout	 the	 day,	 it	 was	 sore	 from	 the	 banging	 yesterday	 and	 the	 day	 before that.	A	dark	bruise	had	begun	to	form	over	the	tender	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 had	 been	 several	 days	 since	 we'd	 last	 seen	 him	 and	 though	 he'd	 left	 us more	food,	he	hadn't	brought	much	that	was	edible.	We	had	even	become	sick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	we	agreed	it	was	the	meat	he'd	given	us	for	breakfast	the	morning	we	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	last.	We	thought	it	had	tasted	fine,	but	then	we	did	not	know	how	it	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	tasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	a	treat,	but	a	treat	that	came	back	to	haunt	us	much	later	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 were	 lucky	 he'd	 also	 emptied	 our	 bathroom	 buckets	 and	 returned	 both	 of them.	 After	 that,	 we	 didn't	 trust	 anything	 else	 he	 had	 given	 us.	 We	 examined every	 can	 and	 its	 contents.	 We	 didn't	 touch	 any	 bent	 or	 rusted	 tins.	 If	 the	 food smelled,	tasted	or	looked	bad,	we	placed	it	in	a	bag	with	other	spoiled	food.	For days,	we	lived	on	the	bottles	of	water	he'd	provided	and	a	few	cans	of	fruit	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	think	he	hears	us…or	cares,”	I	said,	turning	away	from	the	door	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbing	my	sore	hand.	Beth	still	sat	on	her	mattress	but	had	changed	out	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">nightgown	and	was	back	in	her	dirty,	blue	dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 isn't	 going	 to	 b-bring	 us	 any	 more	 f-food.”	 Her	 voice	 wavered	 with emotion.	Her	eyes	glistened	with	the	threat	of	tears,	but	she	sniffed	them	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 any	 could	 fall.	 Her	 body	 became	 rigid	 as	 though	 she'd	 told	 herself	 to toughen	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He'll	bring	us	food,	don't	worry.	He's	taken	a	long	time	before.”	I	hoped	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded	more	convincing	than	I	believed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	seemed	to	think	my	words	over	for	a	moment	before	shaking	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	different	th-this	t-time.	H-he	doesn't	know	w-we	haven't	eaten	most	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 right;	 he'd	 likely	 assumed	 we'd	 eat	 whatever	 he'd	 given	 us.	 But several	 cans	 remained	 untouched,	 their	 contents	 questionable.	 And	 if	 he	 didn't bring	something	else	soon,	hunger	would	drive	us	to	take	the	risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 should	 get	 dressed,	 just	 in	 case,”	 Beth	 said	 pointing	 at	 my	 worn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>nightgown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	soiled,	green	dress	lay	flat	on	top	of	a	box.	It	had	been	a	couple	of	days</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	I'd	been	well	enough	to	change,	though	even	now	I	didn't	see	the	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 barely	 had	 the	 dress	 pulled	 over	 my	 head	 when	 I	 heard	 the	 click	 of	 the lock.	 “He's	 here,”	 I	 called	 to	 Beth,	 my	 voice	 not	 much	 louder	 than	 a	 whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 jumped	 up	 and	 joined	 me	 by	 our	 pile	 of	 boxes.	 We	 stared	 at	 the	 door and	waited	for	him	to	enter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 morning,	 girls.”	 His	 smile	 faded,	 and	 he	 scrunched	 his	 face.	 “What the	hell	is	that	smell?”	he	said	as	he	looked	around	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	sick,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 were	 sick…the	 f-food	 was	 bad.”	 Beth	 crossed	 her	 arms	 and	 glared	 at him	with	her	slightly	sunken	icy	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	stinks	in	here.”	He	looked	around	again	as	if	to	find	the	source	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	buckets	are	full…and	we	need	more	food…and	water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph.”	He	turned	around	and	headed	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!”	I	called,	but	the	door	closed	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 and	 I	 returned	 to	 our	 mattresses	 and	 lay	 down.	 She'd	 been	 right,	 he wasn't	going	to	bring	us	any	more	food,	and	we	were	going	to	starve	to	death	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	creaking	floorboards	woke	us	from	our	light	sleep,	and	we	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	damp	piece	of	hair	stuck	to	my	forehead,	and	I	wiped	it	away.	I	furrowed	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">brow;	I	was	confused	and	didn't	know	how	long	we'd	slept.	I	wiped	a	hand	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 sweat-soaked	 face.	 Beth	 wouldn't	 be	 working	 on	 the	 window,	 at	 least	 not until	evening;	it	was	much	too	hot	in	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 didn't	 say	 a	 word	 but	 walked	 over	 to	 our	 cardboard	 box	 table	 with	 two cloth	bags	and	a	case	of	water	tucked	under	his	arm.	He	set	them	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	stomach	rumbled	at	the	thought	of	food,	and	it	took	everything	I	had	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">jump	up	to	see	what	he	had	brought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eat	it	sparingly.”	He	coughed	a	few	times	and	wiped	sweat	from	his	face.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	you	three	clean	buckets	too,	but	you're	going	to	have	to	trade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	puzzled.  <i class="calibre3">What	did	he	mean…trade? </i>	I	looked	at	our	measly	belongings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	nothing	to	trade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“Information.”	He	tilted	his	head	to	the	side,	and	a	greasy	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">lock	of	hair	fell	into	his	eyes	before	he	brushed	it	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted.	“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>“What	 do	 you	 remember?”	 He	 lowered	 himself	 to	 the	 floor	 and	 leaned against	 the	 wall	 behind	 him.	 The	 door	 to	 his	 left	 was	 open	 but	 not	 enough	 to allow	me	to	see	out	into	the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	what?”	Beth	chimed	in	and	crawled	from	her	mattress	over	to	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	crossed	her	legs	in	front	of	her	and	pulled	the	edge	of	my	sheet	over	her	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything.”	He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?	 Well	 now,	 I	 find	 that	 hard	 to	 believe.	 The	 effects	 of	 the	 memory blocker	should	be	out	of	your	system	now.	While	many	years	of	subjection	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">erase	most,	if	not	all,	your	memory,	Jasper	assured	me	you	hadn't	received	a	full dose	for	several	months.	So.	What.	Do.	You.	Remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mostly,”	I	began,	“just	some	stuff	when	I	was	younger.	I	still	can't	see	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents'	faces.”	I	turned	to	look	at	Beth	who	nodded	in	agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	remember	that	st-stupid	song.”	Beth	folded	her	arms	and	glared	at	Cecil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	raised	his	eyebrows.	“Oh!	And	what	song	is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	the	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	really	I	don't.	Enlighten	me.”	Cecil	folded	his	arms	and	crossed	his	legs</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	ankles.	Their	eyes	locked	in	battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sang	the	first	line,	and	Cecil	smiled.	“You	do	remember.	I'm	pleased.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	not,”	Beth	scowled.	“I	can't	get	it	out	of	m-my	fucking	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth!”	I	warned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	but	it's	t-true.”	She	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	slapped	his	leg	and	snickered.	“Ha!	Wonderful!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	growled	under	her	breath,	but	I	was	pretty	sure	it	was	still	loud	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	Cecil	to	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you?”	Cecil	turned	his	attention	back	to	me.	“Is	it	stuck	in	your	head?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	It	was	the	truth.	Beth	hummed	the	tune	almost	every	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	occasion,	she	would	sing	the	words	in	her	sleep,	a	fact	I	did	not	mention	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	While	I	remembered	the	lyrics	in	their	entirety,	I	wasn't	compelled	to	sing	or hum	 the	 song.	 And	 though	 I	 would	 never	 forget	 it,	 it	 wasn't	 a	 constant	 in	 my brain.	Unlike	Beth,	I	was	able	to	turn	it	off.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	one	out	of	two	isn't	bad,”	he	sneered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	did	teach	it	to	us.	It's	your	song?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	nodded.	“Yes,	April,	it's	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	we	know	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	 unfolded	 his	 arms	 and	 looked	 down	 at	 his	 stained	 purple	 shirt.	 His fingers	plucked	at	some	tiny	remnant	before	flicking	the	offending	piece	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smoothed	his	hands	down	the	legs	of	his	wrinkled	black	pants.	He	uncrossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	crossed	his	ankles.	“Well	–	“</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>“He	t-taught	it	to	us,”	Beth	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	head	whipped	in	her	direction.	She	did	not	move;	her	sunken,	icy	blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	fixed	on	Cecil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	laughed.	“Bravo,	Bethany.”	He	clapped.	The	sound	echoed	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rafters.	“Any	other	memories?	Perhaps	of	your	parents?	Things	they	might	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 shook	 her	 head	 and	 shut	 her	 eyes	 for	 a	 moment.	 “I	 d-don't	 remember anything	about	them	at	all,”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 about	 you,	 April?	 You	 said	 you	 can't	 see	 their	 faces,	 but	 do	 you remember	their	words?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Don't	tell	your	sister.	It'll	be	a	surprise.	Someday,	April,	you	will	need	this.	It</i> <i class="calibre3">opens,	 see?	 Special	 memories,	 hidden	 secrets,	 whatever	 you	 want.	 Hide	 it.	 Be</i> <i class="calibre3">careful. </i>	Echoes	of	their	voices	filled	my	head,	phrases	and	words	that	I	did	not understand.	“No.”	I	rubbed	the	back	of	my	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cecil	 sighed.	 “Well,	 I	 guess	 that's	 all	 for	 now.”	 He	 grunted	 a	 little	 as	 he pulled	himself	up	off	the	floor	and	wiped	at	the	seat	of	his	pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yes,	your	buckets.”	His	nose	wrinkled	as	he	sniffed	the	air.	“I'm	afraid</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm	 still	 going	 to	 need	 something	 in	 trade.	 Unfortunately,	 your	 answers	 didn't provide	me	with	any	pertinent	information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We	 have	 nothing.	 What	 could	 he	 possibly	 take? </i>	 At	 that	 thought,	 I	 looked down	at	the	floor	and	the	mattress	I	sat	on.	My	hand	rubbed	across	the	top	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd	never	wanted	them	when	he'd	first	brought	in	the	cots,	but	they	were	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	only	comfort	we	had.	My	stomach	knotted	at	the	thought	of	him	taking	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	read	my	mind.	“You	can	keep	your	mattresses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	else	did	we	have	to	give? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I	will	take	your	books.	I'm	sure	you	are	sick	of	the	same	stories	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn't	wait	for	either	of	us	to	respond;	instead,	he	headed	over	to	our	pile</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	boxes.	Luckily	for	him,	we	always	put	them	back,	and	so	it	was	just	a	matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 picking	 up	 the	 cartons	 and	 taking	 them	 out	 of	 the	 room.	 We	 sat	 there	 and watched,	too	disappointed	to	move,	too	afraid	to	stop	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 his	 last	 trip,	 he	 returned	 with	 the	 three	 buckets	 he	 promised	 and	 took away	the	full	ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 should	 be	 set	 for	 a	 good	 while	 now.”	 He	 sneered	 at	 us	 from	 the doorway.	I	could	see	the	pile	of	boxes	in	the	hallway	and	wondered	if	he'd	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 downstairs	 or	 just	 leave	 them	 there.	 “Before	 I	 forget.”	 His	 eyes	 were	 no longer	 focused	 on	 me	 but	 on	 Beth,	 who	 had	 yet	 to	 move	 the	 slightest	 as	 she watched	 him.	 “You	 could	 hurt	 yourself	 up	 on	 that	 cabinet,	 so	 stay	 down…</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	face	turned	almost	as	white	as	Cecil's	hair,	and	her	back	stiffened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 really	 should	 do	 something	 about	 that,”	 he	 said	 to	 himself	 as	 he	 looked over	our	heads	and	up	at	the	window.	He	turned	around	and	walked	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	that	answers	the	question	of	whether	he	s-saw	me	or	not.”	Beth	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 stayed	 on	 our	 mattresses	 for	 a	 while	 until	 our	 stomachs	 growled.	 Then we	 rose	 and	 made	 our	 way	 toward	 the	 cardboard	 table	 to	 see	 what	 he	 had	 left behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 you	 get	 me	 my	 plan?”	 I	 asked	 Beth	 as	 I	 finished	 repacking	 the	 cans	 of food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	she	said,	handing	me	the	last	tin	of	fruit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	come	up	with	a	meal	plan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	My	sister's	sunken	eyes	gazed	into	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I	have	a	feeling	he	won't	be	back	for	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Four	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">All	Hope	is	Lost</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rolled	 over	 onto	 my	 back;	 a	 slow	 smile	 spread	 across	 my	 face.	 I	 hadn't forgotten	 where	 we	 were,	 but	 it	 had	 been	 so	 long	 since	 I'd	 had	 a	 sound	 and peaceful	sleep.	And	I	could	only	attribute	it	to	having	a	full	belly.	Although	I'd told	 Beth	 we'd	 have	 to	 be	 careful	 with	 our	 new	 supply	 of	 food;	 we	 had	 eaten until	our	stomachs	could	hold	no	more.	Afraid	some	of	the	food	would	spoil,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	sure	we	ate	it	first	–	we	had	some	catching	up	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkness	 filled	 my	 eyes,	 and	 my	 belief	 I'd	 slept	 a	 long	 and	 peaceful	 night came	 to	 an	 abrupt	 end.	 It	 was	 far	 too	 dark	 in	 the	 room	 to	 be	 early	 morning.	 I blinked	and	waited	for	them	to	adjust	to	the	smallest	amount	of	light,	but	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 nothing.	 I	 couldn't	 even	 see	 my	 outstretched	 hands	 waving	 in	 front	 of	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stormiest	and	darkest	of	nights	had	never	sunk	the	room	in	such	blackness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much	like	that	first	dark	night,	Beth's	movement	alerted	me	to	her	waking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 time	 is	 it?”	 Her	 sleep	 filled	 voice	 whispered.	 I	 was	 still	 trying	 to focus	on	my	hands	stretched	out	in	front	of	me.	“It's	really	d-dark	in	here,”	Beth added	before	I	could	answer	her	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	is.”	I	squinted.	My	ears	sharpened	on	a	familiar	sound.	“Sh!”	I	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	Beth	could	say	anything.	“Do	you	hear	that?”	I	focused	my	attention	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chirps	and	tweets	of	songbirds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Singing	birds,”	Beth	stated;	her	tone	was	flat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 night?”	 It	 was	 what	 I	 assumed;	 it	 was	 too	 dark	 to	 be anything	else.	I	rose	and	tiptoed	toward	the	cabinet.	Once	again	it	reminded	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	first	night	we'd	woken	in	the	dark	room	only	it	had	been	to	the	sound	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rain	on	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cool	and	smooth	surface	of	the	cabinet	doors	met	my	hands.	I	tilted	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	 up	 toward	 the	 window.	 It	 was	 black,	 and	 I	 couldn't	 see	 even	 the	 smallest pinprick	of	light	from	a	distant	star.	I	blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	just	a	d-dark,	cloudy,	moonless	night	–	or	early	morning,”	Bethany	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“No,	I	don't	think	so.	Besides,	I	saw	the	moonlight	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	went	to	bed.	No,	this	is	not	normal,	there's	always	some	sort	of	light,	even	on cloudy	dark	mornings.	This	is	just	black.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 haven't	 s-somehow…gone…”	 She	 paused	 as	 though	 she	 searched	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	word,	“blind?”	Beth	spoke	with	uncertainty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rubbed	 my	 open	 eyes;	 my	 heart	 rate	 spiked.  <i class="calibre3">Was	 there	 something	 in	 the</i> <i class="calibre3">food	that	caused	blindness? </i>	I	shook	my	head;	the	idea	was	absurd.	“I	don't	think so.	 It's	 something	 else.”	 My	 hands	 stretched	 up	 the	 cabinet.	 The	 cool	 wood pleased	 my	 skin	 in	 comparison	 to	 the	 stuffy	 warm	 air	 of	 the	 room.	 I	 put	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>cheek	 against	 the	 door	 and	 closed	 my	 eyes.	 I	 exhaled	 a	 shaky	 breath	 as	 my thoughts	turned	to	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 panic	 grabbed	 hold	 of	 me,	 the	 blackness	 behind	 my	 eyelids	 brightened, and	I	spun	around.	A	dark	figure	stood	in	the	doorway.	I	couldn't	see	his	face	in the	shadows,	but	I	heard	the	smile	in	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 fixed	 your	 window.	 It	 really	 was	 broken,	 moved	 a	 little	 when	 I	 touched it,”	Cecil	said.	“You're	going	to	need	this	now.”	He	set	a	table	lamp	down	on	the floor.	“It's	plugged	in	out	in	the	hall,	so	be	careful	you	don't	pull	it	too	far	from the	door.”	He	closed	the	door	behind	him.	Once	again,	I	stood	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-what	does	he	mean,	he	f-fixed	it?”	Beth	whispered	from	her	mattress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	in	the	direction	of	the	window.	He'd	shaded	the	round	piece	of	glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	given	us	the	first	glimpse	we'd	had	in	years	of	real	sunlight.	He'd	sealed the	 escape	 hatch	 that	 had	 shown	 us	 the	 world	 and	 had	 been	 our	 hope	 for freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	means	he	covered	it	over.”	As	I	said	the	words,	all	the	hope	we	had	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping	drained	from	my	body.	I	was	numb	–	lifeless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	me	a	moment	to	get	my	feet	to	shuffle	back	towards	Beth.	I	asked	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk	to	me	so	I	wouldn't	step	on	her	in	the	dark.	I	worked	my	way	around	both	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	mattresses	and	walked	towards	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	foot	found	the	lamp	first.	I	knelt	down	and	waved	my	hands	in	the	air	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 searched	 for	 the	 shade.	 They	 made	 contact	 seconds	 later.	 I	 held	 onto	 the shade	 with	 one	 hand,	 while	 my	 other	 searched	 underneath	 for	 the	 switch.	 The click	echoed	in	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sudden	 burst	 of	 light	 blinded	 me,	 and	 for	 a	 moment	 a	 dark	 green	 spot blocked	 my	 vision.	 I	 blinked	 it	 away	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 old	 lamp.	 Tiny	 holes dotted	 the	 pleated	 paper	 shade,	 and	 a	 cobweb	 crisscrossed	 the	 open	 top.	 Dents and	scratches	riddled	the	rusted,	brass	coloured	base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	looked	different	in	the	yellow	glow	of	the	old	lamp.	In	one	day,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 changed.	 It	 was	 no	 longer	 a	 place	 where	 we	 found	 hope,	 as	 the	 sun	 shone through	the	window.	Instead,	it	had	become	a	room	with	darkened	corners	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	 or	 anyone	 could	 hide.	 I	 shook	 at	 the	 thought	 as	 I	 glanced	 around	 the nearly	 empty	 room.	 The	 only	 place	 my	 eyes	 didn't	 search	 was	 the	 locked	 door behind	me;	it	only	served	to	remind	me	of	how	trapped	we	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shit!”	Beth	whispered.	She	looked	up	at	me	from	her	mattress;	the	lamp	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor	caused	a	much	larger	shadow	of	her	to	appear	on	the	back	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nudged	 the	 light	 with	 my	 foot.	 Its	 tattered	 and	 yellowed	 shade	 shook	 a little,	and	the	cobweb	strands	undulated.	I	pulled	it	as	far	away	from	the	entrance as	I	could;	the	black	cord	stretched	out	from	underneath	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>Silence	enveloped	the	room.	It	was	as	if	the	lamp	drained	all	our	energy	to use	for	itself	as	both	Beth	and	I	remained	frozen	in	our	places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	we	ever	going	to	g-get	out	n-now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 across	 the	 room	 at	 the	 covered	 window,	 concentrating	 my	 focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	blurred	eyes,	I	spotted	the	tiniest	sliver	of	light,	and	my	heart	skipped.	I rubbed	the	stinging	from	my	eyes	and	blinked.	I	wasn't	seeing	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	staring	at?”	Beth	said.	She	sounded	defeated,	but	I	hoped	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovery	would	make	her	feel	a	little	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	to	the	window.	“There's	light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	turned	her	head	and	followed	my	outstretched	finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	d-don't	see	anything,”	she	said.	Her	head	swiveled	back	and	forth	as	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">searched	for	what	I	could	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	over	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	rose	from	her	mattress	and	moved	to	my	side.	“I	still	don't	see	where.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 guided	 her	 and	 placed	 her	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 I	 pointed	 over	 her	 shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I…Oh!”	she	said,	finally	spying	what	my	eyes	saw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on.”	 I	 caught	 her	 hand	 and	 pulled	 her	 over	 to	 the	 cabinet.	 It	 was	 a little	darker	at	the	other	end	of	the	room.	The	lamp's	wispy	yellow	beams	of	light stretched	across	and	just	reached	the	wardrobe.	“Climb	up.”	I	laced	my	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	so	many	times	before.	Beth	placed	her	foot	in	my	hand,	and	I	pushed	her	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 moment	 later	 she	 pulled	 herself	 on	 top.	 She	 had	 become	 quite	 skilled	 at climbing.	“What	do	you	see?”	I	said	when	she	gathered	herself	up	and	rested	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	searched	for	the	sliver	of	light	we'd	seen	from	the	far	side	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	shadow	warped	around	the	rafters	overhead.	“Hold	on.”	Beth	shifted	closer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?”	 My	 fists	 clenched	 at	 my	 sides	 as	 my	 frustration	 grew.	 That	 tiny sliver	of	light	had	not	been	imagined.	We'd	seen	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	back	from	the	cabinet	and	stood	on	tiptoe	as	Beth	crouched	lower</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	finally	lay	down	on	her	side.	“It's	here,”	she	mumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	out	a	breath.	“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	but	how?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	l-looks	like	it's	not	covered	all	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	tell	what	he	used?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 moment	 Beth	 spoke	 again.	 “It's	 hard	 to	 tell,	 but	 it	 looks	 like	 it's covered	with	wood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 muscles	 tensed.	 I	 had	 hoped	 something	 a	 little	 less	 permanent	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>covered	the	window,	like	a	plastic	sheet.	Discovering	he'd	used	boards	hindered my	 plan	 for	 removing	 the	 window.	 And	 Boards	 meant	 he'd	 used	 nails	 or	 some other	fastener. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	idea	of	nails	and	fasteners	stirred	a	memory.	The	sound	I'd	heard	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep	that	I'd	thought	had	been	part	of	some	strange	dream.	I	closed	my	eyes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recalled	 the	 noise	 and	 understood	 that	 it	 was	 not	 from	 any	 dream.	 It	 related directly	to	the	boarded	up	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	come	down	now.”	I	dropped	my	shoulders	as	hopelessness	washed</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 me.	 There	 was	 no	 point	 in	 Beth	 being	 up	 there	 any	 longer.	 We	 were	 not escaping	from	that	window.	At	that	moment,	every	desire	for	freedom	and	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath	of	survival	flowed	out	of	me	like	blood	from	a	cut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 dangled	 from	 her	 fingertips	 and	 let	 herself	 drop	 to	 the	 floor	 with	 a thump.	Neither	of	us	cared	about	the	noise	she'd	made.	I	imagined	him	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	at	his	ceiling	below	and	smiling	with	victory.	We	trudged	towards	the	centre</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	room;	the	yellow	light	shone	up	at	us	from	the	floor.	I	didn't	have	to	turn around	to	know	that	our	shadows	lumbered	along	behind	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	passed	slowly.	The	yellow	light	had	become	an	agonizing	reminder</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	it	would	be	our	only	light.	The	joy	of	sunlight,	moonlight	and	even	flashes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	lightning,	had	been	stripped	from	our	lives.	We	ate	little,	we	talked	even	less, and	we	slept	a	lot.	Our	light	had	been	extinguished	–	we	felt	hopeless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	first	few	days	went	by,	the	little	sliver	of	light	became	our	guide.	It	was	a beacon,	 though	 small;	 and	 it	 informed	 us	 whether	 it	 was	 day	 or	 night.	 But	 as each	 day	 passed,	 we	 grew	 weary,	 and	 it	 became	 impossible	 to	 care	 about	 that shard	of	light	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	all	time	melted	together,	and	we	forgot	about	the	hope	we'd	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 we	 slipped	 in	 and	 out	 of	 our	 reality.	 I	 no	 longer	 scratched	 the	 passing	 days into	 the	 floor.	 Our	 games	 for	 filling	 time	 between	 daily	 routines	 became unnecessary.	The	food	supply	shrunk	to	a	pitiful	amount.	There	was	no	need	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">discuss	 our	 situation.	 Both	 Bethany	 and	 I	 realized	 that	 the	 room	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">transforming	into	our	tomb. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Five	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A	Guiding	Light</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Day	or	night,	trapped	or	free,	breathe	in	or	breathe	out;	nothing	mattered.	There was	 no	 joy,	 no	 sadness,	 no	 anything,	 only	 existence.	 Bethany	 and	 I	 just	 '  <i class="calibre3">were' </i>, and	I	couldn't	help	but	hope	it	wouldn't	be	for	much	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He, </i>	I	no	longer	thought	of	him	as	someone	deserving	of	a	name,	had	finally brought	 more	 food	 and	 water.	 It	 was	 just	 enough	 to	 keep	 us	 alive;	 to	 keep	 us suffering	for	a	while	longer.	It	was	a	cruel	amount.	And	while	the	thought	of	not eating	 crossed	 my	 mind,	 my	 body's	 will	 for	 survival	 was	 still	 strong.	 Food managed	to	find	its	way	into	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 wandered	 into	 our	 space,	 and	 though	 he	 tried	 to	 ask	 his	 questions about	what	we	remembered,	we	didn't	answer.	We	had	returned	to	our	previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	 of	 silence.	 We	 watched	 with	 unblinking	 eyes	 as	 he	 placed	 a	 bag	 of	 food beside	 the	 old	 lamp	 on	 the	 floor.	 Then	 he	 took	 our	 almost	 full	 buckets	 and returned	with	only	one	-	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn't	 help	 but	 wonder	 what	 we'd	 done	 to	 deserve	 such	 horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">treatment.	We	had	been	treated	better	at	C.E.C.I.L.	We	always	had	plenty	to	eat, </p>
<p class="calibre1">things	 to	 do,	 and	 water	 to	 bathe	 with.	 Now	 we	 were	 nothing	 more	 than	 caged animals	 or	 worse.	 Jasper	 was	 to	 blame,	 and	 a	 small	 part	 of	 me	 hoped	 he'd suffered	a	long	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	conversations	dwindled.	I	tried	talking	about	things	–	memories;	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	only	thing	that	drowned	out	the	screaming	in	my	head.	As	each	day	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	spoke	only	when	it	was	necessary,	and	necessary	wasn't	often.	Beth's	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">faded	until	her	only	responses	to	my	questions	became	grunts.	After	a	time,	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	voice	irritated	my	ears,	and	I	gave	up	talking	too.	The	screaming	inside	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	quieted	to	murmurs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lived	within	myself	for	a	short	while	–	remembering,	imagining,	thinking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	counting.	I	counted	everything	I	could,	rafters	on	the	ceiling,	boards	on	the floor,	nails	in	the	walls,	and	then	I	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	 drove	 me	 crazy	 as	 I	 tried	 to	 make	 sense	 of	 everything	 that	 had happened	to	us	and	the	reasons	why.	My	last	real	thought	was	convincing	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 having	 the	 window	 boarded	 up	 was	 a	 good	 thing.	 Without	 the	 sunlight shining	through,	the	space	didn't	feel	quite	as	hot.	Without	that	sunlight,	we	no longer	 worried	 about	 getting	 out.	 No	 more	 up	 and	 down	 feelings,	 the	 highs	 of believing	we	were	going	to	escape	to	the	lows	of	thinking	we	weren't.	I	finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood	where	it	was	all	going	to	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagining	 made	 me	 anxious	 –	 and	 it	 didn't	 matter	 if	 my	 daydreams	 were happy	or	sad.	Every	fantasy	reminded	me	of	our	imprisonment,	and	I	could	no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>longer	deal	with	the	stress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remembering	 was	 cruel.	 Whether	 it	 was	 remembering	 our	 lives	 before,	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering	 everything	 after.	 My	 brain	 quieted.	 The	 silence	 inside	 my	 head seemed	like	I	was	dying	from	the	inside	out.	If	it	was	death,	I	welcomed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	worst	was	watching	Bethany	slip	away.	I	would	spend	hours	observing</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 while	 she	 slept.	 I'd	 listen	 in	 on	 the	 private	 conversations	 she'd	 have	 with whoever	was	in	her	dreams.	None	of	it	ever	made	sense.	When	she	was	awake, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she'd	spend	her	time	staring	at	the	ceiling	and	drawing	imaginary	pictures	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	finger.	Sometimes,	she	would	reach	under	her	mattress	and	pull	out	the	little brown	 bear	 with	 the	 one	 winking	 eye.	 And	 sometimes	 she	 would	 hum	 that unbearable	tune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 moments	 passed	 –	 empty.	 Not	 even	 the	 sound	 of	 birds	 singing	 outside was	enjoyable;	it	only	reminded	us	of	what	we	were	missing.	Strangely	enough, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	was	one	thing	we	looked	forward	to,	one	thing	that	would	drag	us	from	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads	and	bring	us	back	to	the	room	–	rain.	The	sound	of	rain	drumming	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">roof	overhead	was	soothing,	cooling,	and	even	though	we	couldn't	see	it	or	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	that	sound	still	meant	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Av?”	 Beth's	 voice	 startled	 me	 awake.	 It	 was	 strange	 and	 for	 a	 moment unrecognizable.	She	hadn't	called	me	that	in	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	My	voice	scratched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 listened	 and	 finally,	 my	 ears	 picked	 up	 the	 faintest	 sound	 of	 small	 drops hitting	the	roof.	I	sat	up,	concentrating	on	that	one	thing	that	brought	me	to	life.	I heard	 Beth	 moving	 beside	 me	 and	 knew	 that	 she	 too	 was	 now	 sitting	 up	 and listening.	After	several	more	minutes,	the	rain	drummed	harder.	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	that	s-sound,”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 sat	 there	 quietly	 listening,	 absorbing	 the	 sound.	 Its	 rhythmic	 pounding drove	through	my	body	like	the	blood	rushing	through	my	veins.	Every	once	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 it	 would	 slow,	 and	 I	 found	 myself	 holding	 my	 breath,	 hoping	 it	 wasn't over.	 Then	 just	 as	 it	 sounded	 like	 it	 was	 about	 to	 stop,	 another	 downpour	 of pounding,	deafening	rain	began.	It.	Was.	Freeing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Av?”	Beth	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don't	we	hear	the	truck	anymore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 to	 look	 at	 Beth,	 her	 face	 darkened	 by	 my	 shadow,	 though	 not enough	to	hide	the	worry	I	could	see	in	her	sunken	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 know.”	 My	 eyes	 narrowed	 as	 I	 thought	 about	 her	 question.	 I'd</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>wondered	 too,	 but	 then	 stopped,	 I	 didn't	 want	 to	 think.	 But	 it	 was	 true.	 We	 no longer	heard	the	sound	of	his	truck	rumbling	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shit!	Do	you	think	he's	g-gone?”	she	said,	wide-eyed,	speaking	my	worry</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“I	don't	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 better	 not	 be,”	 she	 whispered	 and	 crossed	 her	 arms.	 A	 hint	 of	 her	 old impetuous	self	made	a	brief	appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph!”	 They	 were	 the	 most	 words	 we'd	 spoken	 in	 days,	 maybe	 even	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week.	I	wasn't	sure	how	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 in	 the	 yellow	 light,	 listening	 to	 the	 rain.	 My	 eyelids	 grew	 heavy	 from the	hypnotic	rhythm.	I	lay	down	on	my	back	and	stared	at	the	ceiling,	waiting	for them	to	close.	Beth	had	already	lain	down	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“April?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uhuh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we	s-switch?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Switch?”	I	rolled	over	onto	my	right	side	and	faced	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Switch	 s-sides.	 I'm	 getting	 tired	 of	 s-sleeping	 this	 way.”	 She	 still	 thought she	spent	all	her	time	facing	me	while	she	slept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	as	Bethany	crawled	onto	my	mattress.	For	a	moment,	I	thought	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	knife	and	the	other	tools	I	kept	hidden.	But	then	it	occurred	to	me	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	longer	needed	–	not	for	the	window,	not	for	protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 crawled	 onto	 Beth's	 mattress	 and	 watched	 as	 she	 settled	 herself	 down	 on mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	yawned.	“Goodnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 yellow	 light	 burned	 behind	 her,	 but	 I	 was	 too	 lazy	 to	 crawl	 over	 and switch	it	off.	It	wouldn't	be	the	first	time	it	stayed	on	while	we	slept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	 bear	 lay	 on	 the	 mattress	 in	 front	 of	 her.	 I	 picked	 it	 up	 and	 held	 it above	my	head.	It	cast	an	ominous	shadow	on	the	ceiling.	I	danced	the	shadow</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	 the	 rafters	 and	 down	 the	 cabinet	 to	 the	 beat	 of	 the	 pounding	 rain.	 After several	 moments,	 my	 arms	 and	 my	 eyelids	 grew	 heavy,	 and	 I	 placed	 the	 bear back	down	on	the	mattress	beside	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	yawn	stretched	across	my	face.	I	reached	down	and	felt	the	heart-shaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">lump	underneath	my	green	dress.	Then	I	slipped	my	hand	inside	the	remaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket.	My	fingers	searched	the	corners,	and	I	pulled	out	the	brown	button.	Like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bear,	I	held	the	button	above	my	face	and	stared	at	it	through	sleepy	eyes.	My fingers	turned	it	slowly;	its	brown	plastic	shone	in	the	yellow	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	sudden	yawn	surprised	me	again,	and	I	dropped	my	arm	to	my	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	button	slipped	from	between	my	fingers	and	rolled	across	the	floor.	My	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">fluttered	open,	and	my	stomach	sunk.	I	crawled	along	the	floor	and	searched	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>area	between	the	mattress	and	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	Beth's	sleepy	voice	called	from	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn't	look	like	n-nothing,”	she	said.	Her	voice	sounded	a	little	cranky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	 back	 to	 sleep.”	 I	 inched	 forward;	 my	 knees	 began	 to	 ache	 from	 the hardwood	floor	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 sighed	 and	 grumbled	 something	 under	 her	 breath.	 I	 waited	 a	 moment for	her	to	settle	down	before	continuing	my	search. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 crawled	 toward	 the	 cabinet	 and	 crouched	 down	 low.	 There	 was	 a	 small space	beneath	it	that	was	no	more	than	half	an	inch	from	the	floor.	It	was	large</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	for	me	to	poke	a	finger	underneath.	I	stretched	out	flat	on	my	stomach</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	my	cheek	pressed	tightly	to	the	floor	and	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth!”	I	whispered.	The	sound	of	her	quiet	snoring	met	my	ears.	“Beth!”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	a	little	louder,	her	only	response	–	a	snort.	“BETH!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	She	said	angrily.	But	she	wasn't	half	as	angry	as	I	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why.	Didn't.	You.	Say.	Anything.”	I	spoke	through	clenched	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About.	What?”	she	mocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-what	light?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 light	 under	 the	 cabinet.”	 I	 blinked	 my	 eyes	 to	 be	 sure.	 A	 shard	 of yellow	light	shone	from	under	the	closet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Six	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Ghost	of	a	Chance</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	crawled	over	to	the	wardrobe	and	lay	down	in	front	of	it.	The	tops	of	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads	touched	as	we	peered	through	a	finger-width	space.	The	light	shone	in	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Had	it	always	been	there?	Where	did	it	come	from? </i>	My	brain	came	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">life,	bombarding	me	with	questions	as	we	stared	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 up	 and	 crossed	 my	 legs	 in	 front	 of	 me;	 the	 light	 disappeared.	 “You never	 saw	 it	 before?”	 I	 said	 to	 Beth,	 who	 still	 lay	 on	 the	 floor	 and	 poked	 her finger	underneath	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 back	 to	 the	 mattresses,”	 I	 said.	 For	 the	 moment	 the	 button	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten.	I	crawled	toward	the	lamp	before	Beth	could	respond	and	turned	it	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	returned	to	my	bed,	I	lay	on	my	side	and	faced	the	cabinet;	the	yellow</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	 glowed	 from	 underneath.	 A	 moment	 later,	 Bethany's	 hand	 touched	 me	 as she	reached	out	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	switched,	remember.”	She	sounded	disappointed	that	she	was	back	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	mattress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 now	 lie	 down	 and	 face	 me.”	 The	 moment	 she	 did,	 the	 light</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared.	 “Face	 the	 cabinet.”	 I	 heard	 her	 shuffle	 over	 onto	 her	 other	 side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	see	it?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Switch.”	 I	 moved	 back	 to	 Beth's	 mattress,	 feeling	 my	 way	 so	 we	 didn't knock	heads.	I	lay	down	again	on	my	back	and	stared	at	the	darkness	overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	in	the	w-way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 in	 the	 way.”	 I	 said	 it	 more	 to	 myself	 than	 to	 Beth.	 “I	 wonder	 if	 that light's	always	on.	Are	you	sure	you	never	saw	it?”	I	rolled	onto	my	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pretty	sure	I	would	have	t-told	you.	Besides,	I	only	sleep	on	my	left	s-side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	could	I	have	s-seen	it	behind	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	my	eyes	and	whispered	under	my	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Beth	did	not	hide	the	irritation	from	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.	Go	to	sleep.”	I	yawned,	unable	to	keep	my	eyes	open	any	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	serious?	We	have	to	do	s-something!”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	seconds	of	my	consciousness	had	faded,	and	I	woke	with	a	start	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	spoke.	My	heart	raced.	She	had	sounded	so	much	louder	than	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	s-said	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	what	you	said,”	I	interrupted.	“Go	to	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>“But	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	groaned.	“Tomorrow.”	I	rolled	over,	away	from	Beth	and	faced	the	cabinet; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	yellow	shard	of	light	became	visible	once	again.	Retrieving	the	brown	button</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	no	longer	a	priority.	I	stared	at	the	light	until	my	heavy	eyelids	closed.	The click	of	the	lamp	switch	resounded	in	my	ears.	Ideas	flickered	like	the	flames	of a	candle	until	surrounding	darkness	snuffed	it	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	 remembered	 the	 light	 the	 moment	 I	 awoke.	 My	 heart	 quickened	 as	 the	 glow met	 my	 eyes;	 it	 was	 still	 there.	 The	 plans	 that	 had	 formed	 before	 I	 fell	 asleep returned,	and	I	was	anxious	to	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tiptoed	toward	the	door	with	my	arms	outstretched	and	counted	my	steps	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 head.	 It	 had	 been	 days	 since	 we'd	 looked	 for	 the	 speck	 of	 light	 that	 shone through	the	tiny	uncovered	portion	of	the	window.	Yet,	in	mere	hours,	that	bit	of sunlight	had	regained	its	importance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	foot	brushed	against	the	base	of	the	lamp,	and	I	took	a	step	over	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">left.	I	shuffled	with	my	arms	stretched	out	in	front	of	me.	A	few	steps	later,	my hands	touched	the	rough	wall.	I	turned	around	and	pressed	my	back	against	it.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">searched	the	dark,	but	I	could	see	no	point	of	light.	We	were	somewhere	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">night	and	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	morning?”	Beth's	sleepy	voice	came	out	of	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said,	confident	in	my	answer.	“Soon,	though.”	I	bent	down	and	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 lamp.	 When	 my	 hand	 touched	 the	 cool,	 metal	 base,	 I	 ran	 it	 up	 the	 post and	searched	for	the	switch.	The	lightbulb	glowed.	I	shielded	my	eyes	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brightness	then	slowly	spread	my	fingers	and	allowed	them	to	adjust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	on	my	bed,	I	focused	my	attention	on	the	wardrobe.	The	cabinet	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 secrets,	 memories,	 and	 ghosts	 of	 past	 C.E.C.I.L	 residents.	 Yet,	 slivers	 of light	shone	both	above	and	below	it	–	slivers	of	hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	 crawled	 in	 beside	 me	 and	 rested	 her	 head	 on	 my	 shoulder.	 We	 sat like	that	for	a	long	time,	quiet	and	still.	Thoughts	and	ideas	were	the	only	things that	raced	around.	They	bounced	off	the	walls	in	my	head;	they	wanted	to	escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	become	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	thing	I	wanted	to	do	was	to	open	the	cabinet	and	let	out	all	those	ghosts, but	 I	 had	 no	 other	 choice.	 I	 reached	 into	 my	 tattered	 pocket	 and	 pulled	 out	 the key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lock	on	the	wardrobe	taunted	me.	“You	have	to	do	it,”	I	called	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany,	the	key	in	my	grasp,	and	my	eyes	fixed	on	the	padlock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	startled	me,	and	my	hand	flew	to	my	chest	as	though	to	keep	my	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>inside.	 I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 “Here.”	 I	 handed	 her	 the	 key	 and	 crouched	 down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	on	my	shoulders,	and	I'll	hold	you	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hands	rested	on	the	floor	in	front	of	me.	Beth	straddled	my	neck.	I	swept</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	lock	of	hair	away	from	my	eyes,	knocked	there	by	her	leg	as	she	moved	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	she	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrapped	my	arms	around	her	legs	and	prepared	myself	to	stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 idea	 sounded	 like	 a	 good	 one,	 but	 my	 body	 did	 not	 want	 to	 cooperate with	 my	 brain.	 The	 meager	 amounts	 of	 food	 had	 weakened	 me,	 and	 Beth	 was heavier	than	I	thought.	Each	time	I	tried	to	move	from	a	crouch	into	a	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">position	my	legs	shook,	and	I	feared	we	would	fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn't	going	to	work,”	I	huffed.	A	bead	of	sweat	dripped	into	my	eye.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	it	quickly,	but	it	stung	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	reach	the	cabinet	with	your	hands?”	Beth	said.	Her	legs	were	hot</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	my	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	mumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	 too.	 Use	 the	 cabinet	 to	 help	 you	 stand,	 and	 I	 will	 p-press	 my	 hands against	it	to	help	steady	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	out	until	my	palms	rested	against	the	smooth	wood.	Then	I	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	up	the	doors	as	my	legs	straightened.	My	knees	wobbled.	My	thighs	shook</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	pressure,	but	I	rose	and	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stepped	 closer	 and	 rested	 my	 forehead	 against	 the	 cabinet	 door.	 The	 cool surface	comforted	me,	and	I	closed	my	eyes.	Drops	of	sweat	ran	down	my	cheek</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	tickled	my	hot	skin,	but	I	did	nothing	to	wipe	them	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	got	it.”	Beth's	mumbled	voice	reached	my	ears	at	the	same	time	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">metal	bar	creaked	open.	“Okay,	put	me	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	legs	crumpled	in	a	controlled	manner,	and	Beth	climbed	away	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders.	I	stood	up	straight,	one	hand	pressed	into	the	small	of	my	back	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	rubbed	my	sweaty	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 not	 that	 h-heavy.	 Look	 at	 me!”	 Beth	 held	 open	 her	 arms	 and	 looked down	at	her	skinny	self;	the	lock	was	still	in	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 her	 a	 half	 smile,	 turned	 and	 faced	 the	 wardrobe;	 Beth	 stood	 at	 my side.	We	stared	at	it	as	though	we	waited	for	the	other	to	pull	open	the	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 few	 moments,	 I	 reached	 for	 the	 handles	 and	 closed	 my	 eyes.	 I	 was ready	to	set	free	an	idea	from	my	head	and	the	ghosts	from	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	the	doors	open,	sure	that	as	I	did,	the	air	around	me	moved	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts	were	once	again	set	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	we	going	to	do?”	Beth	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	her;	even	in	the	yellow	light,	her	skin	looked	pale.	I	glanced	at	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>much	 thinner	 body	 and	 the	 lock	 hanging	 from	 her	 pocket.	 “Empty	 it,”	 I whispered	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	we	can	move	it.”	My	voice	sounded	convincing	as	my	gaze	fell	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	piece	of	furniture,	but	I	wasn't	so	sure	we	could	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-why?”	Beth	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	have	to	face	her	to	know	that	she	was	glaring	at	me.	“Because	we're</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Seven	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Lightening	the	Load</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We	worked	as	fast	as	we	could,	pulling	out	boxes	and	piling	them	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	meager	portions	of	food	we'd	had	weakened	us,	and	we	took	many	breaks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 cabinet	 was	 empty	 of	 the	 small	 cartons,	 we	 stood	 back	 and	 stared	 at the	clothing	that	hung	from	the	bar.	My	skin	prickled.	The	thought	of	touching</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	those	stained	and	worn	items	made	my	stomach	roll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	deep	breath	and	stepped	toward	the	wardrobe,	reaching	up	to	grab</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	first	hanger.	I	stood	on	tiptoes	and	lifted	the	dress	off	the	bar.	It	smelled	of dust	 and	 some	 faint,	 unpleasant	 odour	 unfamiliar	 to	 my	 nose.	 Bethany	 reached out	her	hand	to	take	it	from	me,	but	I	shook	my	head.	I	didn't	want	her	to	touch</p>
<p class="calibre1">it;	it	was	bad	enough	I	had	to.	As	long	as	my	hand	only	held	on	to	the	hanger,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	manage.	I	laid	the	dress	with	care	on	top	of	some	of	the	boxes.	As	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	few	things	that	remained	from	a	resident	of	C.E.C.I.L.,	it	deserved	respect.	I returned	to	the	cabinet	and	grabbed	the	next	piece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	 me	 h-help.”	 Beth	 stepped	 in	 front	 of	 me	 before	 I	 could	 stop	 her.	 She reached	 up	 and	 grabbed	 a	 hanger	 of	 her	 own.	 Her	 quick	 movements	 dislodged the	 lock	 that	 still	 hung	 from	 the	 pocket	 of	 her	 blue	 dress,	 and	 it	 crashed	 to	 the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	still;	our	ears	tuned	in	to	the	sound	of	his	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 several	 moments,	 I	 went	 to	 the	 door	 and	 listened.	 Seconds	 turned	 to minutes,	 and	 there	 was	 no	 sign	 of	 him.	 I	 turned	 my	 ear	 away	 and	 leaned	 my forehead	against	the	door,	closing	my	eyes.	He	wasn't	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 wasn't	 coming,	 not	 now	 and	 not	 later.	 His	 absence	 confirmed	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts	and	fears.	He	was	gone.	He	had	driven	off	and	left	us	to	rot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stomped	over	towards	Beth,	not	caring	as	my	feet	hit	the	floor.	She	stared</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide-eyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on.”	 I	 found	 new	 energy	 in	 my	 anger.	 I	 reached	 inside	 the	 cabinet, grabbed	three	hangers	in	my	hand,	and	yanked	them	from	the	closet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	them.”	I	held	them	out	to	Beth.	“Take	them!”	I	shook	the	clothing.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	yellow	light,	the	freed	dust	floated	to	the	ground.	Without	a	word,	Beth	took the	clothing	from	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 worked	 in	 that	 manner	 for	 several	 minutes	 until	 all	 that	 remained	 were my	 old	 orange	 pyjamas.	 The	 ones	 I	 had	 been	 wearing	 the	 night	 our	 lives changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	only	yours?”	Beth	said	as	I	handed	them	to	her.	“I	don't	think	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	was	mine.”	She	waved	her	hand	over	the	pile	of	clothing	strewn	over	boxes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	on	the	floor.	Our	earlier	care	for	the	items	had	been	short	lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>“I	don't	know,”	I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-now	what?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	the	hard	part.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	nodded,	and	together	we	moved	toward	the	empty	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Sweat	 covered	 my	 forehead	 and	 ran	 down	 my	 neck.	 My	 cheeks	 burned	 with heat.	 We	 panted	 as	 we	 took	 yet	 another	 break	 and	 sat	 down	 inside	 the	 empty wardrobe.	We	sipped	small	drops	from	the	water	bottle	we	shared.	In	the	length</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 time	 we'd	 worked,	 we	 had	 only	 managed	 to	 push	 it	 about	 a	 fist-width	 away from	the	wall.	The	bottom	of	the	wardrobe	had	not	moved	easily	over	the	wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn't	going	to	w-work,”	Beth	said.	Her	once	pale	face	had	taken	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tinge	of	red.	She	leaned	against	the	inside	wall	of	the	closet	and	closed	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	will,”	I	smiled	at	her,	but	behind	my	smile,	I	shared	her	thoughts.	“Let's</p>
<p class="calibre1">try	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-no.”	Beth	shook	her	head.	She	rose	and	stepped	from	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	give	up.”	But	as	I	said	the	words,	I	knew	they	weren't	enough.	Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 over	 before	 I	 knew	 what	 had	 happened.	 One	 second,	 Bethany	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	steps	towards	our	mattresses,	and	in	the	next,	she	lay	flat	on	the	floor.	It took	me	another	few	seconds	to	jump	up	and	move	to	her	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?”	I	said.	Beth	made	strange	gasping	noises.	“Beth?”	She	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 answer,	 and	 my	 concern	 turned	 to	 fear.	 I	 lay	 my	 hand	 on	 her	 shaking shoulder;	 her	 arm	 lay	 across	 her	 face	 and	 hid	 her	 from	 my	 view.	 “Bethany!”	 I called.	 I	 tried	 to	 pull	 her	 arm	 away;	 her	 gasps	 grew	 louder.	 Finally,	 her	 arm dropped	 from	 her	 face;	 the	 yellow	 light	 reflected	 on	 tears	 streaming	 down	 her cheeks.	“Beth,	are	you	hurt?”	My	body	tensed	as	I	stared	at	my	sister	lying	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	shook	her	head;	her	gasping	appeared	to	be	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	my	eyebrows	and	bit	my	lip.	“You're	not	crying?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shook	 her	 head	 again	 and	 after	 another	 moment	 sat	 up.	 “I'm…I'm	 f-</p>
<p class="calibre1">fine,”	she	said	between	fits	of	giggles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	not	hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-no.”	She	inhaled	and	caught	her	breath.	“I	was	laughing.”	She	wiped	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">glistening	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	scared	me.	What	happened?”	I	exhaled	a	breath	of	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	I	s-stepped	on	something	and	s-slipped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	searched	the	littered	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 looked	 around.	 “That!”	 She	 pointed	 to	 the	 lone	 yellow	 shirt	 lying	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>the	floor	in	a	crumpled	mess.	She	had	placed	it	further	away	from	the	others	as	it was	the	only	one	that	didn't	have	the	same	faint	horrible	smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This?”	 I	 picked	 up	 the	 shirt	 and	 held	 it	 out	 to	 Beth.	 The	 material	 was smoother	compared	to	some	of	the	other	articles	of	clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	 me.”	 When	 I	 turned	 around,	 Beth	 still	 stood	 where	 I'd	 left	 her;	 her arms	folded	over	her	chest.	“Please!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine!”	she	huffed	and	joined	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You'll	see.	It'll	be	easier.”	I	smiled,	though	I	wasn't	sure	I	wasn't	also	trying to	 convince	 myself.	 But	 if	 nothing	 else,	 my	 idea	 was	 worth	 a	 try.  <i class="calibre3">You	 have</i> <i class="calibre3">nothing	to	lose; </i>	our	father	whispered	inside	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?”	Beth	tapped	her	foot	as	she	waited	for	me	to	explain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	going	to	stuff	clothing	underneath	the	edges	of	the	cabinet	and	slide</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?”	 Beth	 unfolded	 her	 arms	 and	 dropped	 them	 to	 her	 side.	 I	 had	 her attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	tip	it	back,	and	you	push	the	shirt	underneath.”	My	plan	had	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	groaned.	“Fine.”	She	took	the	yellow	piece	of	clothing	from	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	not	this	one.”	She	laid	the	shirt	down	and	grabbed	clothing	from	a	pile	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor,	peeling	them	from	their	hangers</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not	that	one?”	I	narrowed	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shrugged.	 “It	 reminds	 me	 of	 something,	 but	 I	 don't	 know	 what.	 These are	good	enough.”	She	held	the	dirty,	smelly	clothes	out	towards	me	and	lightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">shook	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 nose	 crumpled,	 and	 I	 cringed.	 “You	 should	 have	 left	 them	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hangers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	tip	the	cabinet,”	Beth	said,	lying	down	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	in	front	of	the	wardrobe	and	pushed	on	the	closed	doors.	The	cabinet</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	heavy.	It	took	all	my	strength,	but	I	managed	to	tip	it	a	bit.	Beth	worked	an article	of	clothing	under	the	front	corners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	t-tip	it	back	a	bit	more?”	Beth	said.	“I	can't	work	these	under	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	heavy,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	 from	 the	 s-side,”	 Beth	 mumbled	 from	 her	 position	 on	 the	 floor.	 She held	a	hanger	in	one	hand	and	was	using	it	to	push	the	clothing	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 moved	 to	 the	 side	 where	 Beth	 lay	 on	 her	 stomach	 and	 placed	 a	 foot	 on either	side	of	her.	I	crouched	low,	my	feet	flat	on	the	floor,	and	leaned	my	back against	 the	 cabinet.	 My	 legs	 straightened	 as	 I	 shoved	 off	 of	 the	 floor;	 my	 back pushed	 against	 the	 wardrobe.	 It	 lifted.	 Seconds	 later	 Beth	 slid	 the	 clothing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>underneath	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 cabinet.	 We	 moved	 to	 the	 other	 side	 and	 within moments	had	two	more	pieces	wedged	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	back	and	smiled,	confident	in	my	plan.	Sweat	trickled	down	my	face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	wiped	it	away;	it	was	time	to	start	the	second	phase	of	my	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	on	opposite	sides	of	the	wardrobe,	each	of	us	with	one	hand	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	and	the	other	on	the	side.	At	the	count	of	three,	we	pushed	and	wiggled	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">closet.	The	small	space	at	the	back	that	we'd	created	earlier	grew	as	the	cabinet slid.	 When	 it	 was	 wide	 enough,	 we	 squeezed	 in	 behind.	 Rubber-like	 chunks	 of gunk	stuck	to	the	bottoms	of	my	bare	feet	and	wedged	between	my	toes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Press	 your	 back	 into	 the	 wall	 and	 push	 the	 cabinet	 forward!”	 My	 heart raced	 with	 anticipation.	 “Ready?”	 I	 placed	 my	 hands	 flat	 on	 the	 back	 of	 the wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Push!”	The	cabinet	moved,	and	my	arms	straightened	as	the	wardrobe	slid</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	away	from	us.	“Stop!”	I	panted.	I	bent	forward	and	cleared	the	chunks	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbery	 goo	 from	 between	 my	 toes.	 “Can	 you	 push	 some	 more,”	 I	 asked	 Beth between	heavy	breaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	busy	checking	her	own	feet.	“I	think	so,”	Beth	gasped	and	returned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 her	 position.	 I	 counted	 to	 three,	 and	 we	 pushed.	 The	 cabinet	 slid	 a	 little	 and stopped.	“Push	again!”	I	closed	my	eyes	for	a	moment,	inhaled	deeply,	and	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly	let	out	the	air,	I	pushed	into	the	wardrobe	with	all	that	I	had	left.	My	arms burned.	It	moved	a	little,	stalled,	and	then	finally	it	slid	again.	With	outstretched arms,	I	placed	one	hand	on	the	wall	and	the	other	on	the	back	of	the	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	did	it!”	I	smiled	at	my	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shook	her	head.	“No,	we	have	to	p-push	it	sideways,	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	smile	faded	from	my	face;	I	was	too	tired	to	push	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tilted	my	head	to	the	side,	my	eyes	squinted.	I	was	also	too	tired	to	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	had	no	idea	what	she	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sighed.	“It's	too	dark	back	here;	we	need	light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 Of	 course,	 she	 was	 right.	 Without	 saying	 anything	 more	 I	 joined Beth.	Together	we	wiggled	the	cabinet	back	and	forth	until	it	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	good,”	Beth	said,	taking	a	deep	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	see.”	She	stood	directly	under	the	boarded	window;	the	yellow	light</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	lamp	across	the	room	lit	up	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 floor	 where	 the	 cabinet	 once	 stood	 looked	 nothing	 like	 the	 rest	 of	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhat	newer	pieces	replaced	what	had	been	there	before.	The	replacement</p>
<p class="calibre1">boards	covered	over	an	opening	in	the	flooring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knelt	down	to	get	a	better	look.	Wedged	between	the	newer	boards	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>circular	piece	of	wood,	slightly	larger	than	my	head.	It	was	far	from	a	perfect	fit as	a	pinky-width	gap	ran	all	the	way	around,	and	a	faint	light	shone	from	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn't	 want	 to	 get	 my	 hopes	 up,	 or	 Beth's,	 but	 I	 was	 sure	 we	 were	 closer	 to freedom	than	ever	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Eight	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Within	an	Arm's	Reach</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	much	as	I	wanted	to	start	ripping	up	the	floorboards,	the	energy	had	drained</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 my	 body.	 My	 stomach	 complained,	 and	 my	 head	 spun	 with	 hunger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">exhaustion,	and	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	and	I	crossed	the	room	to	the	small	amount	of	food	and	water	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining.	We	ate	almost	everything	we	had	left	and	filled	our	stomachs.	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined	we	were	getting	out;	we	no	longer	needed	to	ration	food.	If	for	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason	 we	 weren't	 able	 to	 free	 ourselves,	 then	 it	 didn't	 matter,	 it	 was	 over anyway.	We	were	going	to	starve,	sooner	or	later	–	I	preferred	sooner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 mattresses	 on	 the	 floor	 were	 inviting.	 They	 pulled	 both	 Beth	 and	 me toward	 them	 and	 beckoned	 for	 us	 to	 lie	 down.	 There	 was	 no	 need	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation;	the	moment	for	escape	was	near.	I	closed	my	eyes	and	allowed	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing	memories	of	home	to	fill	my	brain	until	it	felt	like	they	would	pour	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	ears.	Then	I	slipped	into	peaceful	unconsciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	Beth's	shoulders,	trying	to	rouse	her	from	her	sleep.	My	heart	thumped, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 wiped	 the	 sweat	 from	 my	 brow.	 I	 inhaled	 and	 exhaled,	 filling	 my	 lungs each	time	as	I	calmed	myself	and	my	fears.	Beth	groaned	and	rolled	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beth.”	I	shook	her	again	with	a	bit	more	vigour.	There	was	no	telling	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 of	 day	 it	 was,	 and	 I	 hoped	 we	 hadn't	 missed	 our	 opportunity	 of	 escaping during	daylight	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	searched	the	back	wall.	The	lamp's	dim	yellow	light	did	not	reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	old	wood.	I	continued	to	shake	a	still	sleeping	Beth.	Finally,	I	spotted	what	I was	searching	for,	and	my	body	eased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 thread	 of	 light	 found	 its	 way	 through	 the	 gap.	 I	 strained	 my	 eyes, concentrating	on	the	glow.	Bits	of	dust	danced	and	fell	as	the	little	beam	pointed to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	Beth	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	 frig	 sakes,	 April.	 I'm	 t-trying	 to	 sleep.”	 Beth	 had	 returned	 to	 her grumpy	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 smiled.	 “Let's	 get	 to	 work.”	 I	 jutted	 my	 chin	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 our	 new escape	route	and	reached	under	my	mattress.	I	pulled	out	the	pocket	knife	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	rest	of	my	collection.	The	floor	was	our	last	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	knife	blade	slid	into	the	narrow	space	between	the	circular	inset	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floorboards.	I	worked	all	the	way	around,	twisting	and	lifting.	The	few	nails	that held	the	round	piece	of	wood	in	place	squeaked	and	popped	as	they	pulled	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>With	one	final	pop,	the	entire	round	patch	loosened.	I	grabbed	the	edge	with	my fingers	 and	 wiggled	 the	 piece	 back	 and	 forth.	 Finally,	 I	 pulled	 it	 out	 from	 the opening	it	sealed.	Using	the	handle	of	the	knife,	I	hammered	on	the	thin	piece	of wood	attached	to	the	underside	of	the	hole.	After	a	few	strikes,	it	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daylight	 filtered	 through	 the	 opening	 and	 brought	 with	 it	 a	 faint	 putrid smell.	It	was	an	unpleasant,	yet	rather	familiar	odour,	though	I	could	not	identify it.	I	wrinkled	my	nose	and	rubbed	my	aching	fingertips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pew!	That	s-stinks!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	smell	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	look	on	Beth's	face	suggested	she	wasn't	going	to	respond	with	a	verbal</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 leaned	 forward	 and	 looked	 down	 into	 the	 hole	 before	 stretching	 out	 onto my	stomach.	The	floor	below	was	also	repaired	in	the	same	crude	manner.	Light</p>
<p class="calibre1">filtered	 through	 the	 gap	 around	 another	 ill-fitting,	 circular	 piece	 of	 wood.	 The round	wood	patch	was	fixed	to	a	plank.	The	sharp	rusty	ends	of	the	nails	poked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	through	the	board	like	spikes	in	a	pit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stuck	my	arm	through	the	opening,	careful	to	miss	the	nails	and	rested	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	flat	on	the	boards	below.	The	depth	was	the	distance	between	the	palm	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	hand	and	my	elbow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Find	me	something	heavy,”	I	called	to	Beth,	turning	my	head	just	enough	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 sat	 beside	 me	 with	 her	 arms	 wrapped	 around	 her	 drawn	 legs,	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">forehead	 pressed	 to	 her	 knees.	 She	 looked	 up,	 her	 brow	 red	 from	 the	 pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	what?”	We	d-don't	have	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gathered	myself	up	and	sat	cross-legged	in	front	of	the	hole	in	the	floor.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 not	 have	 much,	 and	 in	 my	 head,	 I	 could	 see	 our	 sparse	 belongings.	 “What about	one	of	those	can's	we	didn't	open?”	We'd	eaten	almost	all	the	food	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">left,	except	for	the	stuff	that	looked	undesirable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	jumped	to	her	feet	and	moved	toward	our	small	cache.	A	few	moments</p>
<p class="calibre1">later,	she	returned	with	one	of	the	remaining	cans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 plucked	 the	 tin	 from	 her	 hand	 and	 carefully	 hammered	 on	 the	 nail	 points sticking	up	through	the	plank.	After	several	well-placed	strikes,	one	of	the	nails pierced	the	can,	and	it	began	to	leak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	not	going	to	work,”	I	said,	placing	the	leaking	can	on	the	floor	beside</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 I	 wiped	 my	 wet	 and	 sticky	 hands	 on	 my	 dress	 and	 looked	 back	 down	 the hole.	While	my	hammering	hadn't	removed	the	nails,	it	did	push	some	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	through	the	plank	a	little.	I	was	going	to	need	something	heavier.	I	scanned the	room	and	my	eyes	settled	on	the	only	other	thing	I	could	use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	lamp.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>Beth	raised	her	eyebrows.	“I'll	h-have	to	unplug	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 plodded	 toward	 the	 lamp.	 “Are	 you	 sure?”	 She	 picked	 it	 up	 in	 her hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 have	 no	 other	 choice.	 Anyway,	 if	 it	 doesn't	 work,	 there's	 enough	 light coming	up	through	the	floor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 the	 flashlight.”	 Beth	 pointed	 at	 one	 of	 the	 boxes.	 The	 batteries	 were dying	but	then	so	were	we	if	we	didn't	find	a	way	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hadn't	realized	how	much	I	hated	that	yellow	light	until	Beth	pulled	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cord	from	under	the	door	and	snuffed	it	out.	I	exhaled,	and	the	tension	released</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	my	body.	In	the	darkened	room,	the	thread	of	light	piercing	through	the	gap</p>
<p class="calibre1">combined	 with	 the	 daylight	 shining	 up	 from	 the	 floor.	 Dust	 particles	 danced	 in its	glow	–	it	was	the	only	light	that	mattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 sat	 down	 beside	 me	 and	 handed	 over	 the	 lamp.	 I	 yanked	 off	 the	 dirty shade	 and	 lowered	 it	 through	 the	 opening	 until	 the	 base	 made	 contact	 with	 the nails.	 Then	 I	 raised	 it	 high	 and	 brought	 it	 down	 hard,	 smashing	 it	 against	 the sharp	points.	The	metal	nails	scraped	on	the	base;	it	sounded	as	though	the	lamp</p>
<p class="calibre1">screamed.	 I	 raised	 it	 up	 again	 and	 shoved	 it	 onto	 the	 nails.	 I	 brought	 it	 down harder	 and	 faster	 each	 time,	 enjoying	 the	 feeling	 as	 I	 took	 out	 all	 my	 anger	 on the	ugly	lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!”	Beth	called	above	the	smashing	and	scraping	of	metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	her	with	wide	eyes.	“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	done,”	she	said,	pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	the	lamp	up	and	looked	down	through	the	hole.	Nails	no	longer	poked</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	board	and	the	circular	piece	of	wood	was	no	longer	attached.	More</p>
<p class="calibre1">daylight	 and	 stronger	 odour	 drifted	 up	 through	 the	 hole.	 Beth	 reached	 into	 the opening	 and	 pulled	 out	 the	 plank.	 I	 lowered	 the	 lamp	 through	 the	 hole	 and allowed	it	to	fall	and	smash	on	the	floor	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	you	do	th-that?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shrugged	 and	 smiled.	 “We	 don't	 need	 it.	 Can	 you	 fit	 through	 there?”	 The look	on	Beth's	face	made	me	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	joking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	I	shook	my	head.	“You're	smaller.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	he's	s-still	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tilted	my	head.	“Really?	After	all	that	noise	you	think	he's	still	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	I	get	s-stuck?”	Beth	ignored	my	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	won't	get	stuck.”	I	put	my	foot	down	through	the	opening	in	the	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 pushed	 down	 on	 the	 ceiling	 between	 the	 floor	 beams.	 I	 was	 sure	 it	 wasn't made	 of	 wood	 and	 hoped	 it	 would	 give	 way.	 After	 a	 few	 carefully	 placed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>stomps,	 the	 material	 broke	 apart.	 It	 wasn't	 long	 before	 there	 was	 a	 much	 wider space	between	the	beams.	Bethany	looked	down	through	the	opening	in	the	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	mess	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ew!”	she	wrinkled	her	nose.	“What	 <i class="calibre3">is</i>	that	smell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know.	I've	smelled	it	before,	though,	only	not	as	strong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	go	down,	it	stinks.”	Beth	sat	back	on	her	knees	and	folded	her	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 can't	 smell	 any	 worse	 than	 it	 does	 up	 here.”	 I	 looked	 over	 toward	 the corner,	 with	 our	 one,	 full	 bucket.	 “Here.”	 I	 grabbed	 a	 dress	 from	 the	 pile	 and brought	it	back	over	to	Beth.	“I'll	rip	a	strip	off	the	bottom	of	this	dress,	and	you can	 wrap	 it	 around	 your	 nose.”	 I	 ripped	 the	 worn	 cloth	 and	 held	 out	 a	 strip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bethany	had	no	time	to	protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 if	 I	 don't	 fit	 through	 that	 first	 hole?”	 She	 pointed	 to	 the	 one	 in	 our floor	as	she	brought	the	piece	of	cloth	to	her	face,	ready	for	me	to	tie	on.	“Shit!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	cried	and	dropped	the	piece	of	cloth.	“That	smells	like	whatever	is	wafting</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	through	the	f-floor.”	She	pointed	toward	the	opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	up	the	piece	of	material	and	held	it	to	my	nose.	The	smell	was	faint, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	it	was	the	same	odour	that	drifted	up	from	the	hole	in	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 retrieved	 my	 orange	 and	 yellow	 pyjamas	 from	 the	 top	 of	 a	 small	 pile	 of boxes.	I	put	it	to	my	nose	and	inhaled.	It	smelled	of	dust	and	long-ago	sweat,	but nothing	like	any	of	the	other	pieces	of	clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	use	these.”	I	sat	back	down	on	the	floor	and	pulled	out	the	scissor	tool</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 pocket	 knife.	 I	 cut	 two	 strips	 from	 the	 faded	 pyjama	 bottoms	 and loosely	tied	one	around	Beth's	nose.	“Ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	leaned	over	and	put	her	head	through	the	hole	in	the	floor.	She	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 not	 going	 to	 get	 my	 shoulders	 through	 the	 f-floor.”	 She	 sat	 back	 onto	 her knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	measured	the	width	of	Beth's	shoulders	with	my	hands	and	then	compared</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	to	the	opening.	She	was	right;	her	shoulders	would	never	fit.	We	would	have	to make	the	opening	in	the	floor	wider. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a><b class="calibre4">Thirty-Nine	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Free	Fall</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	down	at	the	hole	in	the	floor	and	pressed	my	fingertips	to	my	forehead.	I leaned	forward,	grabbed	the	edge	of	the	floorboard	and	pulled.	The	rough	edges</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	wood	scraped	the	skin	on	my	fingers,	but	I	didn't	stop.	The	board	moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 and	 down;	 the	 rusty	 nails	 squeaked	 with	 each	 pull.	 But	 my	 strength	 alone wasn't	enough	to	free	the	board	from	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	caught	sight	of	the	piece	we'd	removed	from	inside	the	hole.  <i class="calibre3">I	wonder, </i>	my mind	 questioned	 as	 I	 picked	 up	 the	 plank	 and	 placed	 it	 inside	 the	 opening.	 I angled	it	so	that	one	end	was	underneath	the	floorboard	and	the	other	stuck	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 hole.	 I	 stepped	 on	 the	 protruding	 end	 and	 using	 my	 full	 weight, bounced	on	the	makeshift	lever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	couple	of	attempts,	the	plank	slipped,	and	I	almost	fell	back	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinet	behind	me.	I	tried	again,	but	like	the	last	time,	found	myself	losing	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">balance	 after	 only	 a	 few	 bounces.	 Sweat	 trickled	 down	 my	 cheeks;	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">frustration	grew.	I	had	no	intention	of	giving	up.	We	were	so	close	to	freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	thing	that	would	make	me	quit	was	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	 me.”	 I	 wiped	 my	 hand	 across	 my	 forehead	 before	 the	 sweat	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1">sting	my	eyes.	It	was	the	fifth	time	I'd	fallen	off	the	chunk	of	wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	w-wondering	when	you	were	going	to	ask.”	Beth	rose	from	the	floor; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	strip	of	my	old	orange	pyjamas	still	hung	around	her	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	closed	my	eyes	and	exhaled.	“Stand	beside	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	I	moved	the	plank	into	position	and	stood	on	it.	I	placed	my	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Beth's	shoulder	to	steady	myself.	After	a	few	tries,	it	slipped	from	the	hole.	I yelled	in	frustration;	my	voice	echoed	in	the	empty	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Place	it	on	that	side.”	Beth	pointed	to	the	opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	I	snapped.	My	lips	pressed	together	in	a	tight	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	floorboard	is	wider.	M-maybe	your	lever	won't	slip	out	so	easily.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	down	at	the	flooring	under	my	feet	and	then	at	the	other	side	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hole.	I	tilted	my	head;	Beth	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.”	I	nodded	and	picked	up	the	plank	as	we	moved	across	to	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	before,	Beth	took	up	her	position	at	my	side	and	steadied	me.	With	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">bounce,	the	floorboard	groaned	as	nails	scraped	against	wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	see	if	we	can	pull	it	up	now.”	Beth	and	I	stood	at	opposites	sides	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hole.	We	wiggled	the	loosened	flooring	back	and	forth,	but	it	wouldn't	pull	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	 on.”	 I	 grabbed	 the	 plank	 and	 sat	 down	 on	 the	 floor	 across	 from	 the loosened	floorboard	and	placed	it	inside	the	hole.	I	manoeuvred	it	so	that	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>able	to	hit	the	flooring	from	underneath	like	a	hammer.	It	wasn't	easy,	and	there wasn't	a	lot	of	room	for	movement,	but	the	floorboard	jumped	with	each	whack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	it	looked	as	though	it	was	loose	enough,	I	stopped	my	hammering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	help?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No…I…think…it's…ooff!”	 The	 floorboard	 suddenly	 popped	 free.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">momentum	sent	me	backwards,	and	I	almost	hit	myself	with	the	piece	of	wood	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	still	clutching.	Beth's	hand	flew	up	to	her	mouth.	“Are	you	okay?”	Her	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	wide	as	she	hurried	to	my	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	 Now,	 do	 you	 think	 you'll	 fit?”	 I	 said,	 pointing	 to	 the	 much	 larger opening	in	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	gazed	at	the	space	and	sighed.	“I	g-guess	I	will	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	crouched	and	looked	through	the	hole,	down	into	the	room	below.	Pieces</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	ceiling	and	the	old	lamp	littered	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	still	looks	f-far	down.”	Beth	looked	at	me	with	wide	sparkling	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	glass	elevator!”	I	cried	out	when	the	sudden	return	of	a	memory	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	younger	Beth	came	to	mind.	We	were	riding	in	a	glass	elevator,	and	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	view	amazed	me,	I	could	not	say	the	same	for	Beth.	She	had	buried	her	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 our	 mother's	 hip	 while	 her	 arms	 wrapped	 tightly	 around	 her	 legs.	 Her muffled	cries	had	been	almost	as	loud	as	the	music	inside	the	elevator.	She	never got	over	her	fear	of	heights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Beth	scrunched	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	reason	you're	afraid	of	heights.”	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn	right.”	Beth	folded	her	arms	and	nodded.	The	diffused	light	shining</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	through	the	floor	highlighted	her	pale	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 managed	 the	 top	 of	 the	 cabinet.	 This	 will	 be	 fine	 too.	 We'll	 tie	 the sheets	together,	and	I'll	lower	you	down.	It's	not	that	high.”	I	smiled	at	my	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shook	her	head,	but	her	mouth	agreed.	“Fine.”	She	turned	on	her	heel</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	walked	toward	our	mattresses	before	I	had	a	chance	to	move.	“I	hope	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	l-long	enough,”	she	said	holding	up	both	of	the	sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are.”	I	took	the	sheets	from	her	hands	and	tied	the	ends	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grab	this.”	I	handed	Beth	one	end	of	the	sheet.	We	backed	away	from	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 and	 tugged	 on	 our	 improvised	 rope.	 The	 knot	 tightened;	 the	 sheets remained	attached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.”	I	smiled	reassuringly.	Beth	widened	her	icy	gaze.	“You'll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	better	be.”	She	bunched	up	her	end	of	the	sheet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	you	get	down,	come	up	and	let	me	out.”	I	ignored	the	frown	on	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	rolled	her	eyes	and	plodded	over	to	the	opening.	She	looked	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hole.	“You	should	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>I	sighed.	“I'm	heavier	than	you;	you	can't	hold	me.	You	can	do	this,	Beth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.	Hurry	up	and	t-tie	that	around	me	before	I	change	my	m-mind.”	Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">tossed	the	end	of	her	sheet	at	me	and	raised	her	arms	in	the	air.	I	wrapped	a	part of	 the	 sheet	 around	 her	 a	 couple	 of	 times	 and	 ended	 up	 with	 both	 ends	 in	 my hands.	It	looked	as	though	she	sat	on	a	swing.	I	tugged,	making	sure	the	sheets</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	hold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 sat	 down	 on	 the	 floor	 in	 front	 of	 the	 hole	 with	 her	 legs	 dangling through	 the	 opening.	 “Don't	 let	 go,”	 she	 said	 as	 she	 pulled	 the	 orange	 piece	 of my	old	pyjamas	up	over	her	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	manoeuvred	herself	onto	her	stomach	and	wrapped	her	arms	around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheets.	 I	 gripped	 the	 ends.	 The	 knuckles	 on	 both	 of	 her	 hands	 had	 gone	 white with	tension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won't.	I	promise.”	I	held	the	sheets	tightly	and	placed	a	foot	on	either	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	hole,	bracing	myself.	“Okay,	I've	got	you.	Start	climbing	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	wiggled	and	shimmied	herself	down	through	the	hole.	My	arms	jerked</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	hung	freely	below.	My	biceps	tensed	and	shook	as	her	weight	pulled	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sheets	wrapped	around	my	arms	for	support.	Sweat	beaded	on	my	forehead; </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	feet	pressed	into	the	floor,	and	my	legs	ached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheet	tightened	around	my	arms.	My	hands	tingled.	I	panted	and	slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">loosened	 my	 grip,	 allowing	 the	 sheets	 to	 slip	 through	 my	 hands	 and	 over	 my arms.	My	skin	burned;	my	lower	back	ached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 almost	 there?”	 My	 voice	 strained.	 Beth's	 muffled	 voice	 called</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	and	I	let	go.	The	sheets	slid	through	my	hands	and	across	my	arms.	A	loud</p>
<p class="calibre1">thump	rose	from	below,	and	I	crouched	down	and	looked	through	the	hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sat	on	the	floor	in	ceiling	remains.	She	looked	up	at	me	with	bulging, </p>
<p class="calibre1">icy	 eyes;	 her	 pale	 skin	 glowed	 in	 the	 bright	 light.	 “I	 said,	 NO!”	 she	 yelled through	her	orange	mask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	folded	my	lips	under	as	a	snicker	tried	to	escape.	“Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.”	Beth	stood	up	and	wiped	white	powder	and	tiny	bits	of	ceiling	off	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	blue	dress.	“What	the	hell	did	you	drop	me	for?”	She	called	up,	her	hands	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	hips	as	she	waited	for	her	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	I	couldn't	hear	what	you'd	said.”	I	rubbed	my	chafed	hands	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressions	in	my	arms	left	behind	by	the	sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph,”	Beth	snorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	careful,	and	let	me	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	turned	and	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	straightened	up	and	rubbed	away	the	remaining	pain	from	my	lower	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	walked	over	to	the	door.	My	heart	pounded;	I	rubbed	my	hands	together	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>“Come	on,”	I	whispered,	tapping	my	foot	on	the	floor.	As	each	second	went by,	my	stomach	knotted.	I	put	my	ear	to	the	door	and	closed	my	eyes.	I	was	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	hear	her	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 moments	 passed,	 terrible	 thoughts	 ran	 through	 my	 mind,	 and	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined	 the	 worst.  <i class="calibre3">Was	 he	 still	 here	 waiting	 for	 us?	 Did	 he	 know	 our	 plan? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	did	I	do? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Beth,”	I	whispered	and	leaned	my	forehead	against	the	sealed	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	 burned	 behind	 my	 closed	 lids,	 but	 before	 they	 could	 ooze	 through	 my eyelashes,	a	noise	reached	my	ears.	My	eyes	sprung	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“B-Beth?”	I	called.	My	hands	shook	as	I	placed	them	on	the	door	and	put	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear	to	it	once	again.	“Oh,	please	be	Beth,”	I	whispered.	I	drummed	my	fingers	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wall	 beside	 me.	 Suddenly,	 my	 weight	 shifted.	 I	 jumped	 back,	 and	 the	 door opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a><b class="calibre4">Forty	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">When	One	Door	Opens</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?”	I	grabbed	Beth	by	the	shoulders	as	she	stood	in	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 stared	 up	 at	 me	 with	 wide	 eyes.	 “It's	 creepy	 d-down	 there,”	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	still	here?”	I	looked	behind	her	and	out	into	the	darkened	hallway,	half</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecting	to	see	Cecil	lurking	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	“No,	I	don't	think	so.	But	it	really	s-stinks,	and	there	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	disgusting,	black	flying	things	everywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 shook	 her	 head.	 “I	 was	 too	 busy	 finding	 the	 w-way	 up	 here	 to	 notice anything,	p-plus	the	stink.”	She	waved	a	hand	in	front	of	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sniffed	the	air	out	in	the	hall	and	wrinkled	my	nose.	There	was	a	definite</p>
<p class="calibre1">odour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So…you	didn't	see	Jasper?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shook	her	head.	“The	only	thing	I	paid	attention	to	was	m-my	rolling</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomach	and	not…puking.”	She	stepped	across	the	threshold,	forcing	me	to	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	step	back	into	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	 shouldn't	 we	 be	 leaving?”	 I	 waved	 my	 hand	 toward	 the	 open	 door.	 I didn't	want	to	spend	a	second	longer	in	that	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This,”	Beth	hooked	her	thumb	through	the	orange	strip	of	cloth	around	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">neck	and	held	it	up,	“is	not	thick	enough.	I'm	adding	another	layer.	You	should	t-too.”	She	pointed	to	the	cloth	around	my	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	joined	Beth	at	the	mattresses	and	handed	her	the	pocket	knife.	She	cut	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrow	pieces	of	cloth	from	my	old	pyjamas.	She	handed	me	a	strip	as	she	untied</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	from	around	her	neck.	We	each	folded	our	two	layers	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 hope	 this	 works,”	 Beth	 said	 as	 she	 tied	 her	 strips	 back	 around	 her	 neck and	jumped	to	her	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	up	the	knife	and	put	it	in	my	pocket.	“Ready!”	I	said,	standing	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	fluttered.	I	was	excited	and	nervous	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	nodded.	“Hell,	ya!”	she	smiled.	Her	icy	blue	eyes	filled	with	more	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	I'd	seen	in	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 strange	 standing	 outside	 the	 door.	 Stranger	 still	 was	 finding	 out	 that the	room	we'd	lived	in	was	the	only	one	on	the	second	floor.	The	staircase	was	in the	 middle	 of	 an	 open	 area	 and	 the	 landing	 only	 a	 few	 steps	 away	 from	 the entrance	to	the	room.	Wood	railings	ran	down	along	both	sides	and	at	the	back	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	stairway.	There	were	no	other	doors	anywhere	except	for	the	one	behind	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	small	and	dirty	rectangular	window	at	the	far	end	looked	like	it	had	never</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>seen	 any	 cleanser.	 Boxes	 lined	 up	 against	 the	 walls	 and	 filled	 the	 space	 along each	side	of	the	staircase	and	at	the	back.	A	cleared	area	about	two	feet	wide	ran between	the	boxes	and	the	railing,	and	it	encircled	the	stairway.	In	some	places, the	cartons	almost	reached	the	ceiling.	Pushed	against	the	wall	to	my	left	was	the cart	Jasper	had	used	when	we'd	first	arrived.	Dirty	food	containers	piled	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top;	there	were	moldy	crusts	of	bread,	and	bowls	caked	with	dried	oatmeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	check	those	out.”	I	pointed	to	the	cartons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Closest	to	the	room	were	the	boxes	of	books	and	other	things	that	Cecil	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">given	us	and	then	taken	away.	Beside	them	were	a	couple	of	large	buckets	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognized	them	as	ones	we'd	used.	The	lid	on	one	had	lifted;	the	smell	of	waste</p>
<p class="calibre1">permeated	the	air.	I	wrinkled	my	nose	and	held	back	a	gag	as	I	reached	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	pushed	the	lid	into	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 metal	 skeletons	 of	 our	 cots	 leaned	 against	 the	 wall.	 I	 trailed	 a	 finger along	 one	 of	 the	 cool,	 metal	 slats.	 Beth	 followed	 along	 behind;	 our	 footfalls echoed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	out	and	ran	my	hand	over	the	top	of	the	table	we'd	once	used	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked	past	it.	The	wood	was	smooth	under	my	fingertips,	except	for	one	spot.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">paused	for	a	second	as	my	fingers	found	the	rough	edges	of	a	gouge.	There	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	need	to	look	at	the	mark.	The	feel	of	the	carving	itself	was	enough	to	spark</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	memory	of	its	creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 had	 been	 filling	 our	 mouths	 and	 bellies	 with	 warm	 oatmeal	 that	 Jasper had	provided	us.	While	we	ate,	I	recounted	a	dream	to	Bethany.	It	was	the	dream</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	which	I'd	remembered	her	name.	Beth	had	grabbed	the	spoon	she'd	been	using</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	scratched	her	name	into	the	wood	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	closed	my	eyes	and	shook	the	memory	away	as	my	feet	continued	to	pull</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 along	 the	 row	 of	 boxes.	 I	 stopped	 when	 I	 reached	 the	 first	 small	 stack	 of unfamiliar	 ones.	 The	 cartons	 varied	 in	 size	 and	 while	 some	 were	 empty,	 most were	 not.	 Some	 boxes	 were	 not	 sealed,	 and	 their	 contents	 spilled	 out	 over	 the top,	their	sides	bulged.	Other	cartons	held	only	a	few	items. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 dipped	 my	 hand	 into	 one	 of	 the	 emptier	 boxes	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 small figurine	of	a	boy	and	his	sheep.	I	traced	a	finger	along	the	sheep's	head,	noting one	of	its	ears	was	missing.	The	edges	of	the	break	were	rough	to	the	touch	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	sharp.	I	placed	it	back	inside	the	box	that	seemed	to	have	been	its	home	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	years.	I	sorted	through	the	other	objects	and	found	a	mismatch	of	trinkets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">some	dishes	and	even	an	old	shoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	good	in	there?”	Beth	whispered	beside	me	as	she	pulled	back	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 flaps	 to	 get	 a	 better	 view.	 Though	 her	 voice	 was	 quiet,	 I	 started	 at	 her unexpected	question.	My	heart	skipped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	when	I'd	calmed	and	moved	on	to	the	next	carton.	It	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>much	larger	box,	and	in	the	manner	in	which	the	lid	bulged,	it	was	definitely	one that	 was	 full.	 With	 a	 light	 tug	 on	 the	 folded	 flaps,	 the	 contents	 revealed themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	a	blue	blanket	out	from	the	top	and	handed	it	to	Beth.	She	held	it	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	her	face	and	nestled	her	cheek	into	its	softness,	her	eyes	closing	as	she	did.	I smiled	and	turned	back	to	the	rest	of	the	items.	There	were	a	few	more	blankets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bed	 sheets	 and	 pillowcases,	 and	 even	 a	 couple	 of	 table	 cloths.	 When	 I	 finished rummaging,	I	stuffed	them	back	inside.	We	continued	along	the	back	wall.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 fewer	 boxes	 and	 most	 were	 empty,	 but	 a	 few	 contained	 items	 I	 deemed useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Beth	and	I	continued	back	up	along	the	other	side,	another	bulging	box</p>
<p class="calibre1">caught	my	eye.	I	reached	over	to	release	the	flaps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	l-looking	for	anyway,”	Beth	said;	her	voice	was	a	little	louder</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	one	shoulder.	“I	don't	know.”	I	pulled	on	the	cardboard	flaps	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened	the	box.	My	eyes	widened.	It	contained	clothing.	It	was	old	clothing,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	clean,	and	while	a	few	articles	were	too	small,	most	could	prove	useful.	I smiled	as	I	held	up	a	pair	of	dark	grey	sweat	pants.	I	pressed	the	soft	material	to my	 cheek	 for	 a	 moment	 before	 laying	 them	 back	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 rest	 of	 the clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 should	 go,”	 I	 said	 turning	 to	 Beth	 who	 was	 busy	 examining	 an	 old sweater.	 I	 was	 suddenly	 filled	 with	 the	 awful	 thought	 of	 Cecil	 returning	 and finding	that	we'd	escaped.	We	needed	to	get	out	of	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 led	 Beth	 down	 the	 stairs.	 With	 each	 step,	 the	 putrid	 smell	 grew	 stronger and	the	black	flying	things	materialized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Flies,”	I	said	to	Beth	as	I	recalled	the	name	and	swatted	at	one	that	buzzed</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	we	reached	the	bottom,	I	had	pulled	the	orange	fabric	up	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	nose.	It	helped	–	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	bottom	of	the	stairs,	we	turned	to	the	right.	As	we	rounded	the	corner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	could	go	one	way	or	the	other.	We	turned	to	the	left	and	entered	a	living	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	was	directly	below	where	he'd	kept	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 furnishings	 were	 sparse	 and	 consisted	 of	 a	 small	 brown	 couch	 and	 a chair.	A	pillow	and	a	pile	of	folded	blankets	covered	the	one	end	of	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	also	an	odd	screen	that	belonged	either	to	a	computer	or	a	television. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whichever	it	was,	it	was	old,	and	I	doubted	it	worked.	Chunks	of	the	ceiling	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	brass	lamp	littered	the	floor.	At	the	front	of	the	room	was	the	door	–	our	way out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	further	into	the	living	area.	Below	the	gaping	hole	in	the	ceiling	sat</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>a	wood	burning	stove.	I	knew	what	it	was	the	moment	I	saw	it.	Our	grandfather had	 had	 one	 along	 with	 other	 relics	 he'd	 stashed	 in	 his	 old	 barn.	 The	 corner	 of my	lip	twitched	as	the	memory	came	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	up	at	the	hole	and	back	down	at	the	stove.	Bits	of	the	ceiling	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 top	 along	 with	 books,	 a	 glowing	 lamp,	 and	 several	 other	 nameless	 items. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 grandfather's,	 it	 too	 was	 missing	 its	 stove	 pipe.	 Its	 presence	 explained	 the round	 holes	 in	 the	 ceiling	 and	 the	 floor	 in	 the	 room.	 At	 one	 time	 it	 had	 been used.	 I	 crouched	 down	 and	 looked	 through	 the	 glass	 door.	 Several	 items	 filled the	 inside	 including	 paper,	 cloth,	 dishes,	 and	 what	 looked	 like	 the	 skeletal remains	of	a	tiny	animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	 go!”	 Beth	 tugged	 on	 my	 arm	 as	 she	 tried	 to	 pull	 me	 forward,	 but	 I couldn't	 leave.	 Despite	 my	 earlier	 haste,	 my	 curiosity	 drove	 me	 to	 explore	 our prison	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	on,	Beth.	I	want	to	look	around	a	bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously?	What	if	he	comes	b-back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soon,	Beth.”	I	knew	it	was	a	chance	I	was	taking,	but	I	had	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 turned	 back	 and	 walked	 past	 the	 entrance	 to	 the	 staircase.	 There	 were two	doors,	one	on	the	left	and	one	on	the	right,	both	closed.	I	placed	my	hand	on the	doorknob	of	the	door	on	the	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	protested	with	a	loud	gasp.	“Might	not	be	a	g-good	idea,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ignored	her	and	turned	the	knob. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a><b class="calibre4">Forty-One	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Behind	Closed	Doors</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stench	was	so	strong	that	I	drew	back	and	slammed	the	door	but	not	before	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fly	escaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	disgusting!”	Beth	whined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 to	 see	 Beth	 covering	 her	 nose	 with	 both	 of	 her	 hands	 despite	 the double	layer	of	cloth	tied	around	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	as	we	stepped	away	from	the	door	a	sudden	noise	from	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room	caught	my	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!”	I	held	up	my	hand	to	Beth	and	turned	back	toward	the	door.	I	put	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear	against	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!”	 I	 interrupted.	 I	 closed	 my	 eyes	 and	 concentrated,	 sure	 that	 I'd	 heard some	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	probably	just	a…m-mouse	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	up	my	index	finger	and	tapped	my	lips,	signaling	for	Beth	to	be	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	was	about	to	give	up	listening,	another	sound	came	through	the	door,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	sure	it	was	a	groan.	I	placed	my	hand	on	the	doorknob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	Beth	grabbed	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone's	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	probably	Cecil,”	Beth	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	might	be	Jasper,”	I	whispered	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	shook	her	head.	“He's	dead.”	She	swatted	at	the	fly	buzzing	around	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	going	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 released	 my	 arm,	 reached	 up	 behind	 her	 head	 with	 both	 of	 her	 hands and	untied	her	mask.	“You're	going	to	need	this	more	than	m-me.”	She	held	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 two	 pieces	 of	 orange	 cloth.	 I	 took	 them	 with	 no	 argument	 and	 tied	 them around	my	face.	I	stared	at	her	wide-eyed,	my	heart	already	thumping	faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	wait	right	here.”	She	pointed	to	the	spot	where	she	stood.	“But	close	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded	 and	 turned	 the	 knob.	 The	 stench	 assaulted	 my	 nose	 through	 the cloth	as	I	stepped	into	the	room;	my	eyes	watered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	was	small	and	ordinary.	The	bare	and	dirty	white	walls	looked	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 hadn't	 seen	 paint	 in	 years.	 Pushed	 into	 the	 corner	 and	 up	 against	 the	 wall was	a	single	bed.	It	had	neither	headboard	nor	footboard,	and	on	it,	a	body	laid</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	and	quiet,	completely	covered	by	a	dirty,	light	blue	sheet.	An	old	and	dark wood	nightstand	was	inches	away	from	the	head	of	the	bed.	A	small	blue	lamp</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>sat	in	the	middle	and	an	almost	empty	water	bottle	lay	on	its	side.	A	once-white dresser	stood	opposite	the	foot	of	the	bed	and	between	them	was	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flies	 buzzed	 around	 a	 bucket	 filled	 to	 the	 top	 with	 human	 waste	 –	 the	 lid half	off.	My	stomach	rolled,	and	I	gagged	beneath	my	mask.	My	throat	burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 taste	 of	 the	 stomach	 acid	 that	 I	 promptly	 swallowed	 back	 down.	 I moved	toward	the	dirty	window	across	from	the	bedroom	door,	careful	to	avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	full	bucket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	frame	was	old	and	cracked	in	several	places,	and	I	hoped	it	would	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	pushed	up	the	sash.	The	wood	squeaked	in	protest.	I	loosened	my	grip	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	the	window	slip;	it	was	not	going	to	stay	up	on	its	own.	My	gaze	fell	on	the window	 sill.	 Cracks	 ran	 through	 the	 old	 paint	 and	 bits	 had	 chipped	 away	 and littered	the	floor.	A	weathered	piece	of	wood	rested	against	the	frame.	I	held	the window	with	one	hand	and	grabbed	the	board,	propping	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cool	breeze	swept	through	the	screenless	opening.	I	stuck	my	head	out	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	 my	 eyes.	 Sunshine	 bathed	 the	 top	 of	 my	 head	 in	 warmth,	 and	 another breeze	blew	through	my	hair.	I	imagined	how	much	nicer	it	would	have	been	if	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn't	weighed	down	by	dirt.	I	reached	up	and	scratched	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	trailed	down	to	the	covering	on	my	face,	and	I	pulled	it	off	just	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	for	my	nose	to	stick	out.	I	inhaled;	my	lungs	expanded	to	capacity,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweet	smelling,	clean	air	was	heaven.	I	turned	my	head	to	the	right	and	opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	eyes.	The	forest	stretched	out	around	the	house	in	all	directions.	I	squinted	as a	 clearing	 in	 the	 trees	 caught	 my	 attention.	 Several	 objects	 poked	 out	 of	 the ground.	They	weren't	trees,	but	from	that	distance,	I	couldn't	tell	what	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 at	 them	 trying	 to	 focus	 on	 the	 shapes,	 but	 numerous	 trees	 were	 in	 the way.	No	matter	how	I	moved	my	head,	I	couldn't	get	a	clear	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 sudden	 groan	 startled	 me,	 and	 I	 whacked	 my	 head	 on	 the	 bottom	 of	 the window.	I	groaned	in	reply	and	pulled	my	head	back	inside.	I	turned	around	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspected	 the	 top	 of	 my	 head	 with	 my	 fingers.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 my	 eyes focused	on	a	lone	hanger	hanging	from	the	open	closet	in	the	corner	of	the	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	around	the	stinking	bucket,	swatting	away	the	flies	and	reached	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hanger.	I	placed	the	hooked	end	over	the	edge	of	the	lid	and	set	it	back	onto the	bucket.	The	action	trapped	several	flies	inside;	their	buzzing	amplified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fresh	air	circulated	through	the	window,	and	I	moved	toward	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 reached	 out	 with	 a	 shaky	 hand	 and	 pinched	 the	 dirty	 sheet	 between	 my thumb	and	index	finger.	I	drew	it	back,	gasped,	and	fell	to	my	knees.	I	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 mouth	 with	 my	 hand	 as	 my	 stomach	 rolled	 again	 and	 threatened	 to	 fill	 my mouth	with	its	contents.	Tears	burned,	but	this	time	it	was	not	from	the	smell.	I closed	my	eyes	and	settled	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>A	 lock	 of	 his	 dark	 hair	 had	 fallen	 over	 his	 eyelids,	 and	 I	 gently	 brushed	 it away.	His	once	beautiful	brown	skin	was	ashen	and	cold	to	the	touch.	The	sharp, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	edges	of	his	cheekbones	gave	him	the	look	of	someone	much	older.	Dried</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood	filled	the	cracks	in	his	lips,	and	where	they	weren't	cracked,	they	took	on	a bluish,	grey	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jasper,”	I	whispered.	With	great	care,	I	placed	my	hand	on	his	shoulder.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	easy	to	feel	the	hard	outline	of	bone	underneath	the	sleeve	of	his	shirt.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	withered	away	and	was	almost	a	skeleton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasper's	eyes	rolled	beneath	his	lids.	A	weak	groan	came	from	his	parted	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyelids	 fluttered	 and	 then	 opened;	 our	 eyes	 locked.	 My	 memory	 flashed	 to his	 soft	 brown	 eyes	 peering	 above	 his	 white	 mask	 into	 my	 almost	 lifeless	 eyes when	we	were	in	C.E.C.I.L. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">How	things	have	changed</i>,	I	thought,	as	I	peered	over	my	orange	mask	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	almost	lifeless,	brown	eyes.	They	focused	and	lit	up	with	recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ap-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sh!”	I	stopped	him	from	speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	exhaled	a	wheezy	breath,	and	I	held	my	own	as	I	waited	for	his	chest	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rise	again.	His	lips	moved	to	speak.	I	leaned	forward	and	placed	my	ear	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	mouth.	His	words	were	slow	and	strangled,	but	I	understood	each	one.	Tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">blurred	my	vision	as	I	concentrated	on	what	he	was	trying	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded	 and	 moved	 away.	 Reaching	 for	 the	 bottle	 on	 the	 nightstand,	 I unscrewed	 the	 lid	 and	 held	 it	 to	 his	 mouth,	 tilting	 it	 slowly.	 The	 clear	 liquid trickled	down	the	neck	of	the	bottle	and	into	his	parted	lips.	He	swallowed	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 the	 empty	 bottle	 away	 and	 dropped	 it	 on	 the	 floor.	 We	 stared	 at	 each other	for	a	few	seconds	more	before	he	closed	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	the	mask	from	my	face,	not	caring	about	the	stench	and	leaned	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 kiss	 Jasper's	 cheek.	 I	 stroked	 the	 back	 of	 his	 hand;	 my	 fingers	 bumped	 over each	bone.	My	eyes	watched	the	rise	and	fall	of	his	chest.	I	don't	know	how	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 took.	 It	 may	 have	 been	 seconds	 or	 hours.	 In	 that	 moment,	 time	 was	 of	 little consequence.	And	when	it	was	over	I	leaned	back	against	the	nightstand,	hugged</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	legs	to	my	chest	and	rested	my	head	upon	my	arms.	Tears	poured	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	like	rain	as	I	gave	in	to	my	sobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	quiet	knock	at	the	door	followed	by	Beth's	voice.	“April!”	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">called.	Through	blurred	eyes,	I	saw	my	sister	standing	in	the	doorway.	Her	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed	over	her	mouth	and	nose,	her	own	eyes	wide.	“Is	he…”	she	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Just,”	I	choked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	sorry,”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	me	a	favour?”	I	stood	up	from	my	spot	on	the	floor	and	pulled	the	mask</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	over	my	nose;	the	smell	was	stronger	when	standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>Beth	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	me	one	of	those	blankets	from	the	box,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 back	 and	 stared	 at	 Jasper.	 In	 death,	 he	 looked	 more	 at	 ease	 and peaceful	than	he	had	moments	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	 colourful	 and	 bright,”	 I	 said.	 “I	 think	 he	 would	 like	 that.”	 I looked	back	at	Beth	and	wiped	the	remaining	tears	from	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	and	left	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	to	Jasper	and	knelt	on	the	floor	beside	the	bed.	I	ran	my	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	side	of	the	mattress	until	it	met	the	box	spring	and	pushed	it	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	journal	was	easy	to	find,	right	where	he	said	it	would	be,	and	I	pulled	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">out.	It	was	thick,	and	its	black	leather	cover	was	worn	with	age	and	use.	I	poked my	finger	inside	the	spine	and	felt	for	the	piece	of	string	Jasper	told	me	would	be there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	it	a	tug,	and	a	small,	black	cloth	bag	came	free.	I	placed	the	journal	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	nightstand	and	sat	down	on	the	floor.	I	untied	the	golden	strings	and	dumped</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	contents	into	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	the	small	gold	heart	on	its	chain,	an	exact	copy	of	mine,	the	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	for	Beth.	I	picked	it	up	between	my	fingers	and	dangled	it	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 heart	 swayed,	 occasionally	 catching	 a	 bit	 of	 light	 coming	 in	 through	 the window.	I	smiled	at	its	perfection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'What's	that?”	Beth's	voice	startled	me	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	necklace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 dropped	 the	 chain	 into	 my	 pocket	 and	 looked	 at	 Beth	 standing	 in	 the doorway.	I	smiled	and	pointed	at	the	blanket	she	held	in	her	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	looked	down.	“It's	all	I	could	f-find.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 perfect.”	 I	 stood	 up	 and	 walked	 toward	 my	 sister.	 She	 held	 out	 the orange	and	gold	blanket	to	me,	and	I	took	it	from	her	hands.	I	turned	toward	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed	and	kissed	Jasper	on	the	cheek	one	last	time	before	pulling	the	sheet	over	his head.	I	placed	the	colourful	blanket	over	his	body	and	tucked	the	edge	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 mattress	 and	 the	 box	 spring.	 I	 returned	 to	 the	 nightstand	 and	 grabbed	 the journal	before	meeting	Beth	at	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	aren't	you	wearing	your	necklace?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 reached	 down	 the	 front	 of	 my	 dress	 and	 pulled	 the	 golden	 heart	 from underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…”	She	looked	at	me	with	narrowed	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	into	my	pocket	and	pulled	out	the	other	one.	“This	one	is	yours.”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>smiled	 and	 held	 out	 the	 ends.	 Beth	 turned	 around,	 and	 I	 placed	 it	 around	 her neck	and	fastened	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 understand,”	 she	 said,	 turning	 to	 face	 me.	 She	 looked	 down	 at	 the gold	 heart	 with	 its	 tiny	 butterfly	 hanging	 at	 her	 chest	 and	 poked	 at	 it	 with	 her finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	all	here,”	I	said,	holding	up	the	journal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	eyes	widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	explain.”	I	indicated	the	way	out	with	my	hand	and	Beth	left	the	room.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	 back	 and	 looked	 at	 Jasper's	 covered	 form;	 fresh	 tears	 stung	 my	 eyes.	 I wiped	 them	 away	 before	 they	 could	 trickle	 down	 my	 cheek.	 I	 pressed	 my fingertips	 to	 my	 lips	 and	 blew	 my	 kiss	 in	 Jasper's	 direction.	 “Goodbye,”	 I whispered	and	closed	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a><b class="calibre4">Forty-Two	</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Free</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	tell	me	what's	in	that	b-book?	Where	did	it	come	from?”	Beth</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 held	 my	 breath	 and	 pulled	 down	 my	 mask,	 wiping	 my	 still	 running	 nose with	the	back	of	my	hand.	I	replaced	the	mask	before	sniffing.	My	eyes	ached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Later,	I	want	to	look	around	first,”	I	said.	My	hand	rested	on	the	doorknob</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	other	closed	door.	A	part	of	me	worried	Cecil	would	return.	The	memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 strange	 clearing	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 house	 came	 to	 mind	 –	 there	 was	 that too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hinges	squeaked	as	the	door	opened.	The	small	bathroom	housed	a	toilet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	sink.	The	toilet	had	no	seat,	and	a	trail	of	rust	ran	down	the	back	of	the	sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Water	dripped	at	a	steady	pace	like	a	ticking	clock.	Every	drop	echoed	as	it	fell into	the	drain.	I	closed	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 strips	 of	 cloth	 were	 not	 effective,	 and	 I	 found	 myself	 taking	 shallow breaths.	 Beth	 followed	 along	 behind,	 cursing	 under	 her	 breath	 about	 the	 smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	only	one	more	area	to	check	at	the	back	of	the	house,	and	by	the	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	entrance,	I	suspected	it	was	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	saw	him	the	moment	we	crossed	the	threshold.	He	sat	slumped	over	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kitchen	table	in	the	corner	of	the	room.	His	cloudy	grey	eyes	stared	at	us;	the putrid	odour	saturated	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ugh!”	Beth	gasped,	her	hands	covered	her	face.	“That's	disgusting!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	wait	in	the	front	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	p-problem	with	that.”	She	spun	around	and	left	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	approached	the	table,	my	anger	greater	than	any	disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you	suffered.	I	hope	you	choked	on	your	tongue.”	The	words	spilled</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	my	mouth	in	a	voice	I	did	not	recognize.	I	snickered	at	the	sight	of	a	bowl</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	hard	candy	in	front	of	him;	his	hand	still	held	on	to	a	few.	“Well,	that's	just	as good.”	 I	 shrugged	 and	 walked	 out	 of	 the	 kitchen	 and	 back	 to	 the	 front	 room.	 I exhaled	 a	 sigh	 of	 relief.	 The	 one	 I'd	 been	 holding	 for	 months,	 or	 perhaps	 even longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 stood	 in	 the	 front	 room	 staring	 at	 something	 I	 couldn't	 see	 from	 my place	in	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	looking	at?”	I	said,	as	I	moved	into	the	room	and	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	beside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That.”	 She	 pointed.	 Mounted	 to	 the	 wall	 was	 a	 digital	 photo	 frame.	 “I just…p-pushed	a	button.”	Beth	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pictures	 of	 children	 scrolled	 through	 the	 digital	 display.	 Some	 were	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>younger	 than	 us,	 others	 the	 same	 age	 or	 a	 little	 older,	 but	 they	 all	 stood	 on	 the same	front	porch.	And	every	picture	included	a	person	dressed	in	a	bulky	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">suit.	 A	 respirator	 and	 gloves	 completed	 their	 costume.	 I	 couldn't	 see	 the	 eyes behind	 the	 mask,	 but	 I	 knew	 as	 I	 stared	 at	 each	 photo	 that	 it	 was	 him.	 It	 was Cecil	who	had	posed	with	these	children.	I	couldn't	see	his	face,	but	I	knew	that he	smiled	behind	that	respirator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recognized	the	clothing.	They	were	the	same	articles	that	had	hung	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cabinet	and	were	now	scattered	around	the	room.	They	were	the	children	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	stayed	here	long	before	us	–	the	lab	rats.	My	heart	sank	as	I	looked	at	their smiling	faces;	they	were	completely	unaware	of	their	fate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	there	are	thirty	of	them,”	Beth	said	in	a	voice	not	much	louder	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded	 and	 focused	 on	 the	 faces.  <i class="calibre3">Did	 I	 ever	 meet	 any	 of	 them	 before	 at</i> <i class="calibre3">C.E.C.I.L? </i>	They	were	not	familiar	to	me,	at	least	not	in	any	of	the	memories	I'd recovered.	“Wait!”	I	called	as	an	image	on	the	screen	scrolled	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	s-someone?	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	rewind	it	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 stepped	 over	 to	 the	 frame	 and	 pushed	 a	 couple	 of	 buttons	 until	 the pictures	scrolled	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!”	I	called,	pointing	to	the	photo	that	appeared.	“Stop	it	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	pushed	another	button,	and	the	picture	froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	he?”	Beth	said	as	she	came	back	to	stand	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	the	picture	of	the	boy	and	flipped	open	the	journal	to	the	middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	was	a	worn,	folded	piece	of	paper.	I	recognized	each	wrinkle	as	I	traced</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	fingers	over	the	sheet.	I	pulled	it	out	and	unfolded	it.	The	boy	stared	back	at me	with	his	still	laughing	eyes.	I	held	up	the	sketch	beside	the	photo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think?”	I	asked	Beth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 stepped	 closer.	 Her	 eyes	 narrowed	 as	 they	 moved	 back	 and	 forth</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 the	 screen	 and	 the	 sketch.	 “I	 think	 it's	 pretty	 g-good.”	 She	 smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	l-look	identical.	Who	is	he?”	she	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 folded	 the	 paper	 into	 quarters	 and	 placed	 it	 back	 in	 the	 journal.	 I	 stood beside	Beth.	“He,”	I	said,	“is	our	baby	brother.”	The	minute	I	said	the	words	out loud	a	faint	memory	came	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	Are	you	sure?”	Beth	turned	to	look	at	me.	Despite	her	mask,	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	that	her	mouth	was	wide	open	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“It	was	one	of	the	things	Jasper	told	me	before	he…Anyway,	yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	looked	down	at	the	floor.	“Does	that	m-mean	he's…”	She	cleared	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">throat,	turned	and	pointed	at	our	bother's	photo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed.	 “No,	 or	 yes…Jasper	 said	 he'd	 escaped.	 He	 was	 the	 only	 one	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	he	m-might	still	be	alive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	he	might.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	else	is	in	that	b-book?”	Beth	flicked	her	head	back	a	little	and	pointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	chin	in	the	direction	of	the	journal	I	held	in	my	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jasper	told	me	he	wrote	down	what	he	knew.	There	is	some	information	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	about	Cecil	and	his	plan.”	I	tightened	my	grip	on	the	journal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	plan,”	Beth	scoffed.	“Jasper	was	in	on	his	plan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 but	 when	 he	 knew	 it	 wasn't	 about	 saving	 people,	 but	 about	 so	 much more,	he	did	everything	he	could	to	stop	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	gaze	left	my	face	for	a	moment.	“He	said	all	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	in	so	many	words.	But	it	was	enough	for	me	to	piece	together.”	Jasper's</p>
<p class="calibre1">weak	and	breathy	whispers	replayed	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	rubbed	a	hand	over	her	forehead	then	adjusted	her	cloth	mask.	“Ya,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">still…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	sorry.	He	asked	for	my	forgiveness,	and	I	gave	it	to	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	his	n-name?”	She	turned	and	faced	the	digital	frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“Caleb.”	His	name	reminded	me	of	the	memory,	and	I	moved	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	 to	 the	 pile	 of	 debris	 on	 the	 floor.	 I	 dropped	 to	 my	 hands	 and	 knees	 and sifted	through	the	pieces	of	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	The	pitch	of	her	voice	fluctuated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	me	look.”	I	stopped	for	a	moment	and	gazed	up	at	my	sister.	She	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	and	joined	me	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 are	 we	 looking	 for?”	 She	 said	 as	 she	 tossed	 a	 large	 piece	 of	 the material	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	button.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	stopped	searching	and	sat	back	on	her	knees.	“A	button?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	a	brown	button,	it	was	in	my	pocket.	I	dropped	it;	it	rolled	under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinet	 and	 through	 the	 floorboards	 and	 now	 it's	 here.”	 I	 tossed	 a	 piece	 of	 the ceiling	over	my	shoulder.	“It's	got	to	be	here,”	I	said	more	to	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	searched	through	the	fragments,	tossing	large	pieces	behind	us.	Finally, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all	that	remained	was	a	small	pile	of	white	dust	and	tiny	bits	of	wood	and	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	back	on	my	knees	and	wiped	the	sweat	from	my	forehead	with	the	back	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 powder	 white	 hand.	 I	 squeezed	 my	 eyelids	 together	 and	 sealed	 in	 the emotion	that	was	about	to	escape.	It	had	been	just	a	button,	but	as	more	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories	returned,	the	button	became	more	significant.	I	had	to	find	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	it	is!”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	large	breath	blew	out	from	my	lips.	Between	Beth's	dirty,	powder	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers	she	held	an	equally	dusty	brown	button.	I	plucked	it	from	her	fingers	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>cleaned	it	off	on	my	green	dress.	The	brown	plastic	button	gleamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	is	that	s-so	important?”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	that	little	bear	of	yours?	This	happens	to	be	its	eye.	Well,	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	going	to	replace	the	original	one	with.	That	bear	was	Caleb's	favourite.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">cried	 when	 the	 eye	 came	 off	 and	 then	 he	 lost	 it.	 I	 found	 this	 button	 and	 was going	to	sew	it	on,	but	Caleb	had	already	gone	to	bed	with	his	one-eyed	bear.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	the	button	in	the	pocket	of	my	orange	and	yellow	pyjamas	and	went	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	night	they	came.”	My	skin	prickled	at	the	memory	of	shadows	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	bedroom	waking	me	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth	sprang	to	her	feet	and	hurried	toward	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 are	 you	 going?”	 I	 rose	 and	 brushed	 the	 debris	 from	 the	 ceiling	 off my	clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Getting	the	bear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Later.	 There's	 more	 to	 explore.	 Then	 we'll	 take	 what	 we	 can,	 and	 we'll leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.”	Beth	rejoined	me	in	the	living	room.	I	tucked	the	brown	button	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corner	of	my	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	you	can	go	out	through	the	back	door	in	the	kitchen?”	I	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Beth,	remembering	her	earlier	reaction	to	seeing	Cecil's	dead	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hell	ya.	That	creep	is	d-dead,	he	just	stinks,	but	I'll	hold	my	breath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 smiled	 under	 my	 mask,	 but	 I	 was	 sure	 it	 showed	 in	 my	 eyes	 as	 it	 did	 in Beth's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	quick	and	quiet	walk	down	the	hall.	My	focus	trained	on	the	back	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beth's	head	as	she	led	the	way.	Both	of	us	held	our	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pushed	 open	 the	 screen	 door,	 and	 we	 stepped	 outside.	 Like	 butterflies emerging	from	their	cocoons,	we	were	ready	to	spread	our	wings	and	test	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vast	 surroundings.	 We	 didn't	 bother	 to	 untie	 our	 strips	 of	 cloth	 and	 instead yanked	 them	 over	 our	 heads.	 Our	 lungs	 gorged	 on	 fresh	 air.	 The	 cool	 grass soothed	my	bare	feet.	I	tilted	my	face	toward	the	sky.	Though	still	early	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	the	sun	had	disappeared,	and	I	suspected	it	was	behind	a	few	clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on,	 I	 want	 to	 look	 at	 something.	 We've	 got	 the	 rest	 of	 our	 lives	 to revel	in	the	fresh	air.”	I	reached	for	Beth's	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	walked	hand-in-hand	through	the	long	grass	toward	the	edge	of	the	trees</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	stopped	before	the	clearing.	It	was	easier	to	see	from	our	new	vantage	point</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I	couldn't	see	well	from	the	bedroom.	Wooden	crosses	stuck	out	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground,	each	engraved	with	an	ID	number. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?”	Beth	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A…”	the	word	escaped	me	for	a	moment,	“cemetery,	sort	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 dropped	 Beth's	 hand	 and	 led	 us	 through	 the	 few	 trees	 and	 out	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>clearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ground	was	hilled	before	each	wooden	cross,	except	for	one.	Below	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">marker	was	an	open	hole.	An	ID	had	been	carved	into	the	wood,	and	it	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	as	the	one	carved	inside	the	cabinet.	It	was	Caleb's	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	imagine	Caleb	escaping	and	the	direction	he'd	gone	as	I	looked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	forest	around	us.	Random	patches	of	wildflowers	caught	my	attention,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked	away	from	the	cemetery.	Beth	followed	behind,	neither	of	us	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 marveled	 at	 the	 tiny	 creatures	 that	 flew	 and	 crawled	 around	 each	 bloom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	names	unknown	as	I	either	didn't	remember	or	I	never	knew	it.	I	hoped	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">blew	 one	 iridescent	 bug	 off	 the	 back	 of	 my	 hand,	 that	 their	 names	 would someday	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 picked	 as	 many	 flowers	 as	 our	 hands	 could	 hold	 and	 delivered	 a	 small bunch	to	each	cross	with	a	silent	prayer.	I	swallowed	the	tightness	in	my	throat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	rubbed	my	stinging	eyes.	When	we	had	enough,	we	walked	back	toward	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	the	small	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	at	the	front	entrance;	the	dirt	and	rocks	scratched	at	my	bare	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sensation	was	pleasant.	I	tilted	my	head	back	and	stared	at	the	large	board</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	covered	what	had	once	been	our	only	hope	of	escape	for	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smirked;	satisfied	that	another	one	of	Cecil's	plans	had	failed.	I	reached	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 freed	 the	 heart	 pendant	 from	 under	 my	 dress	 and	 rubbed	 it	 between	 my fingers.	It	would	no	longer	have	to	hide	from	Cecil.	My	father's	voice	once	again whispered	 in	 my	 ear.	 I	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 pendant,	 convinced	 that	 it	 did	 hold secrets,	but	how	to	access	them,	I	had	no	clue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	breeze	blew	through	my	hair,	and	I	closed	my	eyes,	dropping	the	pendant</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 my	 fingers.	 It	 thudded	 against	 my	 chest	 then	 came	 to	 rest.	 I	 inhaled.	 My nose	had	never	been	happier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	the	porch	in	the	pictures,”	Beth	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dropped	my	head	and	opened	my	eyes.	It	was	the	porch,	exactly	as	it	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 stood	 there	 staring,	 I	 imagined	 all	 the	 children	 before	 us	 standing	 on that	porch.	Cecil's	arm	had	wrapped	around	their	shoulders	as	though	he'd	cared</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	he'd	had	other	plans.	Those	children	meant	nothing	to	him.	They	were	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">guinea	pigs.  <i class="calibre3">Why	had	these	particular	children	been	picked	to	come	here?	Why</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">had	Caleb? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	breeze	picked	up	again,	and	the	warm	air	brushed	my	hair	back.	I	gazed</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	at	the	grey	sky;	clouds	swirled	in	a	mesmerizing	pattern.	Children's	laughter</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled	 the	 air.	 When	 I	 looked	 toward	 the	 porch,	 I	 was	 sure	 I	 saw	 their	 ghosts running	from	the	house,	finally	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 drop	 of	 rain	 fell	 on	 the	 top	 of	 my	 head;	 it	 tickled	 as	 it	 slowly	 ran	 down</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>through	my	hair	and	onto	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	Beth	gasped.	She	stared	at	me	with	wide,	icy	blue	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rain,”	I	said	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rain!”	she	replied</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grabbed	 her	 hands	 in	 mine	 as	 the	 rain	 began	 to	 fall	 around	 us	 –	 washing away	the	dirt,	the	pain,	the	sorrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 laughed	 as	 we	 danced	 and	 skipped	 in	 circles.	 The	 rain	 saturated	 the ground	below	my	feet	and	as	we	spun	bits	of	mud	splashed	against	my	legs.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	pebble	wedged	itself	between	my	toes,	and	I	kicked	my	leg	out	to	the	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 set	 it	 free.	 Beth	 tossed	 her	 head	 back	 with	 laughter;	 ringlets	 bounced	 on	 her shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	the	pebble	sailing	through	the	air,	we	were	free.	Free	to	go	wherever	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted,	free	to	find	our	brother.	We	had	much	to	do	before	we	could	leave,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	now,	we	were	happy	just	playing	in	the	rain. </p>

<p class="calibre1">April	and	Beth	have	escaped,	and	their	captor	is	dead.	Freedom	is	in	their	grasp	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	only	they	knew	where	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 some	 memories	 returning,	 April	 and	 Beth	 struggle	 to	 find	 answers	 to their	questions.	What	they	know	is	that	they’ve	been	vaccinated	against	a	strange virus.	But	what	happened	to	their	family,	and	to	the	rest	of	the	world? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 head	 out,	 they	 stumble	 onto	 the	 compound	 where	 their	 nightmare began,	 but	 the	 empty	 building	 only	 brings	 more	 mystery	 into	 their	 lives.	 Soon, they	 encounter	 others	 wandering	 on	 the	 numerous	 trails	 throughout	 the	 woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	April,	finding	her	family	is	priority	one;	for	Beth,	it's	sticking	to	the	trails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 can	 April	 ever	 convince	 her	 to	 leave	 the	 forest...	 and	 why	 are	 they being	hunted? </p>
